      "[CLS] Introduction: Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging may allow for microscopic characterization of white matter degeneration in early stages of Alzheimers disease. Methods: Multishell Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired from  100 participants (40 cognitively normal, 38 with subjective cognitive decline, and 22 with mild cognitive impairment [MCI]). White matter microscopic degeneration in 27 major tracts of interest was assessed using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging, and q-space imaging. Results: Lower DTI fractional anisotropy and higher radial diffusivity were observed in the cingulum, thalamic radiation, and forceps major of participants with MCI. These tracts of interest also had the highest predictive power to discriminate groups. Diffusion metrics were associated with cognitive performance, particularly Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test immediate recall, with the highest association observed in participants with MCI.

Measures sensitive to early neurocognitive [MASK] associated with ARHL would help to elucidate the mechanisms underpinning this relationship. We hypothesized that ARHL might be associated with decline in visual short-term memory binding (VSTMB), a potential  biomarker for preclinical dementia due to Alzheimers disease (AD). We examined differences in accuracy between older adults with hearing loss and a control group on the VSTMB task from a single feature (shapes) condition to a feature binding (shapes-colors) condition. Hearing loss was associated with a weaker capacity to process bound features which appeared to be accounted for by a weaker sensitivity for change detection (A).

We included 183 subjects with a two-year follow-up: 50 NC stable (NCs), 23 NC-to-MCI converters (NCc), 50 MCI stable (MCIs), 35 MCI-to-AD converters (MCIc), 25 AD stable (ADs). ANCOVA analyses were used to identify baseline brain atrophy in converters compared with non-converters. To explore the relative merits of [MASK] over individual regional volumetric measures in prediction of disease progression, we searched for the optimal cutoff for each measure in logistic regressions and plotted the longitudinal trajectories of these brain volumetric measures in converters and non-converters. Baseline [MASK] performed the best in differentiating NCc from NCs (odds ratio 26.35, AUC 0.740) and MCIc from MCIs (odds ratio 8.91, AUC 0.771). The [MASK] presented greater increase in the second year for NCc vs. NCs  but not for MCIc vs. MCIs. Baseline [MASK]s were also associated with CSF-based and PET-based AD biomarkers.

      "[CLS] Alzheimers disease, and dementia, represent a common cause of disability and one of the most relevant challenges in the health world. In addition, these conditions do not have, at moment, a pharmacological treatment that can stop the  pathological progress. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), defined as the borderline between normal aging and early dementia, represents a meaningful field of study because, in the transition to dementia, clinicians have defined a useful therapeutic window. Additionally, due to the lack of effective pharmacological interventions, recent years have seen an increase in research into new technological solutions to assess, stimulate, and assist patients afflicted with  Alzheimers disease. This review aims to outline the use of information and communication technologies in the field studying MCI. Particularly, the goal is to depict the framework and describe the most worthwhile research efforts, in order to display the current technologies available, describe the research objectives, and delineate prospective future researches. Regarding data sources,  the research was conducted within three databases, PubMed [MASK] Web of Science, and Scopus, between January 2009 and December 2017. A total of 646 articles were found in the initial search. Accurate definition of the exclusion criteria and selection strategy allowed identification of the most relevant papers to use for the study. Finally, 56 papers were fully evaluated and included in this review. Three major clinical application areas have been portrayed, namely \"Cognitive Assessment,\" \"Treatment,\" and \"Assistance.\" These have been combined with three main technological solutions, specifically \"Sensors,\" \"Personal Devices,\" and \"Robots.\" Furthermore, the study of the publications time series illustrates a steadily increasing trend, characterized by the enrollment of small groups of subjects, and particularly oriented to the subjects assistance using robots companion.

      "[CLS] Traditionally regarded to coordinate movement, the cerebellum also exerts non-motor functions including the regulation of cognitive and behavioral processing, suggesting a potential role in neurodegenerative conditions affecting cognition, such as Alzheimers disease (AD). This study aims to investigate neuropathology and AD-related molecular changes within the neocerebellum using post-mortem human brain tissue microarrays (TMAs). Immunohistochemistry was conducted on neocerebellar paraffin-embedded TMAs from 24 AD and 24 matched control cases, and free-floating neocerebellar sections from 6 AD and 6 controls. Immunoreactivity was compared between control and AD groups for neuropathological hallmarks (amyloid-ß, tau, ubiquitin), Purkinje cells (calbindin), microglia (IBA1, HLA-DR), astrocytes (GFAP) basement-membrane associated molecules (fibronectin, collagen IV), endothelial cells (CD31/PECAM-1) and mural cells (PDGFRß, aSMA). Amyloid-ß expression (total immunolabel intensity) and load (area of immunolabel) was increased by >4-fold within the AD cerebellum. Purkinje cell  counts, ubiquitin and tau immunoreactivity were unchanged in AD. IBA1 expression  and load was increased by 91% and 69%, respectively, in AD, with no change in IBA1-positive cell number. IBA1-positive cell process length and branching was reduced by 22% and 41%, respectively, in AD. HLA-DR and GFAP immunoreactivity was unchanged in AD. HLA-DR-positive cell process length and branching was reduced by 33% and 49%, respectively, in AD. Fibronectin expression was increased by 27% in  AD. Collagen IV, PDGFRß and aSMA immunoreactivity was unchanged in AD. The number of CD31-positive [MASK]s was increased by 98% in AD, suggesting the increase in CD31 expression and load in AD is due to greater [MASK] number. The PDGFRß/CD31 load ratio was reduced by 59% in AD. These findings provide evidence of molecular changes affecting microglia and the neurovasculature within the AD neocerebellum. These changes, occurring without overt neuropathology, support the hypothesis of  microglial and neurovascular dysfunction as drivers of AD, which has implications on the neocerebellar contribution to AD symptomatology and pathophysiology.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: The relation of retinal thickness to neuropsychological indexes of cognitive impairment in patients [MASK] Alzheimer disease (AD) remains an area of investigation. The scope of this investigation was to compare volume and thickness changes of neuronal retinal layers in subjects [MASK] AD [MASK] those of age-matched healthy controls and to estimate the relation between cognitive functioning evaluated by neuropsychological assessment and thickness changes of the retina. METHODS: This was a prospective single-site study where we evaluated 25 subjects  [MASK] probable AD matched for age, sex, and education to 17 healthy control subjects (HC). All participants underwent a full medical evaluation, neuropsychological assessment, and optical coherence tomography (OCT) to evaluate the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) thickness, ganglion cell complex (GCC) thickness, and macular volume. RESULTS: The pRNFL thickness of AD patients showed a significant overall reduction compared [MASK] healthy controls (P = <0.0001). Furthermore, pRNFL was reduced in each retinal quadrant, particularly the inferior, nasal, and superior  quadrants. GCC thickness and macular volume were reduced in AD patients in comparison [MASK] HC (P = 0.004; P = 0.001). Of particular interest was the correlation between OCT findings and neuropsychological assessment; we did not find a significant association of retinal thinning [MASK] worse MMSE score, but reduction of macular volume was associated [MASK] worse constructional praxis performance. Impairment of semantic-lexical and processing speed was associated [MASK] attenuation of macular GCC thickness.

      "[CLS] OBJECTIVE: To identify subtypes of neuropsychiatric symptom (NPS) course among cognitively normal individuals, and to assess the association between these subtypes and hazard of later MCI or dementia diagnosis. METHODS/DESIGN: We modeled neuropsychiatric inventory questionnaire (NPI-Q) scores from 4,184 volunteers over approximately four years using growth mixture models, generating latent classes of trajectory. We then fit Cox proportional hazard models to determine if membership in trajectory classes was [MASK] with increased hazard of diagnosis of MCI or dementia. RESULTS: We identified four trajectory classes: the majority of the sample (65%)  would be expected to belong to a class with consistently low or zero NPS. The next most prevalent class, (16%) showed a decrease over time in NPI-Q total score but, compared to the majority class had an almost 3-fold increase in hazard of MCI or dementia (HR: 2.92; 95% CI: 1.82-4.68). Another class (14%) showed an increase in NPS over time, and was also [MASK] with greater hazard of MCI or  dementia (HR: 3.96; CI: 2.61-6.03). The smallest class (5%) had high and fluctuating NPI-Q total scores, and had the greatest hazard (HR: 4.57; CI: 2.72-7.63). CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated that is is possible to identify meaningful groups of NPS trajectories, and that trajectory of NPS can convey information beyond a single cross-sectional measure. While even those whose NPS improved were at increased hazard of MCI or dementia, hazard increased as a function of the severity of the NPS trajectory. [SEP]\t\tassociated\n",

      "[CLS] Background Epidemiological evidence implies a link between heart disease and dementia. However, few prospective studies have assessed the association between  serum NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) levels and dementia.  Methods and Results A total of 1635 community-dwelling Japanese elderly aged =60 years without dementia (57% women, mean age±SD 70.8±7.7 years) were followed  up for 10 years. Serum NT-proBNP levels were divided into 4 categories (=54, 55-124, 125-299, and =300 pg/mL). The hazard ratios were estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model. During the follow-up period, 377 subjects developed all-cause dementia, 247 Alzheimer disease, and 102 vascular dementia. The age- and sex-adjusted incidence of all-cause dementia was 31.5 per 1000 person-years and increased significantly with higher serum NT-proBNP levels, being 16.4, 32.0, 35.7, and 45.5, respectively (P for trend <0.01). Subjects with serum NT-proBNP levels of =300 pg/mL had a significantly higher risk of all-cause dementia (hazard ratio=2.46, 95% CI 1.63-3.71) than those with serum NT-proBNP levels of =54 pg/mL after adjusting for confounders. Similar risks were observed for Alzheimer disease and vascular dementia. [MASK] of the serum NT-proBNP level into a model with known risk factors for dementia significantly improved the predictive ability for incident dementia (c-statistics 0.780-0.787, P=0.02; net reclassification improvement 0.189, P=0.001; integrated discrimination improvement 0.011, P=0.003). Conclusions Higher serum NT-proBNP levels were significantly associated with an increased risk of dementia.

      "[CLS] In this paper, we propose a novel method for magnetic resonance imaging based Alzheimers disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) diagnosis that systematically integrates voxel-based, [MASK] and patch-based approaches into a unified framework. Specifically, we parcellate the brain into predefined regions based on anatomical knowledge (i.e., templates) and derive complex nonlinear relationships among voxels, whose intensities denote volumetric measurements, within each region. Unlike existing methods that use cubical or rectangular shapes, we consider the anatomical shapes of regions as atypical patches. Using complex nonlinear relationships among voxels in each region learned by deep neural networks, we extract a \"regional abnormality representation.\" We then make a final clinical decision by integrating the regional abnormality representations over the entire brain. It is noteworthy that the regional abnormality representations allow us to interpret and understand the symptomatic observations of a subject with AD or MCI by mapping and visualizing these observations in the brain space. On the baseline MRI dataset from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance for four binary classification tasks and one three-class classification task. Additionally, we conducted exhaustive experiments and analysis to validate the efficacy and potential of our method. [SEP]\t\tregion-based,\n",

      "[CLS] INTRODUCTION: Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) is characterized by a prominent deficit in visuospatial abilities. Visuospatial impairment is also detectable in  the course of Alzheimers dementia (AD). However, visuospatial impairment presents some differences in these two conditions, suggesting pathological involvement of distinct [MASK] circuits. Recent studies applied a new method to score the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) pentagon copy subtest, namely the  Qualitative Scoring Pentagon Test (QSPT), which is a sensitive measure of visuospatial abilities. Using [18F]fluorodeoxy-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), we assessed the relationship between in vivo [MASK] metabolic dysfunction and visuospatial deficits, in terms of QSPT total value, in DLB and AD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty Patients were diagnosed as DLB (n?=?35) and AD (n?=?25) dementia according with the standard research diagnostic criteria. Each  patient underwent a FDG-PET scan as support for the final diagnosis. Patients underwent an extended neuropsychological evaluation, including MMSE, language, memory, executive functions and visuospatial abilities tests. The MMSE QSPT scoring was calculated following the methods by Caffarra et al. (2013). Offline voxel-wise correlation analysis between QSPT total scores and FDG-PET [MASK] metabolism was then performed, correcting for MMSE, sex and disease duration. RESULTS: Both groups presented reduced visuospatial performances, as assessed by  QSPT scores. DLB compared to AD showed a statistically significant difference in  QSPT rotation parameter (p?=?0.022). In DLB, worse performance at QSPT total score, i.e. more severe visuospatial impairment, correlated with [MASK] occipital  hypometabolism (i.e. lateral occipital cortex, calcarine cortex, fusiform and lingual gyri). In AD, worse performance at QSPT total score correlated with [MASK] hypometabolism in the right parietal cortex (i.e. superior and inferior parietal  cortex and angular gyrus). DISCUSSION: These findings reveal that visuospatial deficits may derive from distinct [MASK] alterations in AD and DLB. We propose that the inabilities to perform correctly the QSPT task is related to altered visuoperceptual process in  DLB, and visuospatial process in AD. This is consistent with our results showing  hypometabolism in [MASK] system related to visuoperceptual processing, namely the  occipital cortex in DLB, and visuospatial processing, namely parietal cortex in AD.

Nine middle-aged  flies were tracked as they died during normal aging, and fifteen young flies were tracked as they died from dehydration/starvation stress. Episodes of increased FDHC were observed 0-8?h prior to death for the majority of the flies. FDHC was also increased with age in flies with neuronal expression of a human Abeta42 protein fragment associated with Alzheimers disease. Finally, green autofluorescence appeared in the eye and body immediately prior to and coincident with death, and fluorescence of GFP targeted to the retina increased immediately  prior to and coincident with death. The results suggest the potential utility of  FDHC, green autofluorescence, and retinal GFP as markers of neuronal malfunction  and imminent death. [SEP]\t\tvelocity,\n",

      "[CLS] The intrinsically disordered human islet amyloid poly[MASK] (hIAPP) is a 37 amino acid [MASK] hormone that is secreted by pancreatic beta cells along with glucagon and insulin. The glucose metabolism of humans is regulated by a balanced ratio of insulin and hIAPP. The disturbance of this balance can result in the development of type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), whose pathogeny is associated by  self-assembly induced aggregation and amyloid deposits of hIAPP into nanofibrils. Here, we report pressure- and temperature-induced changes of NMR chemical shifts  of monomeric hIAPP in bulk solution to elucidate the contribution of conformational substates in a residue-specific manner in their role as molecular  determinants for the initial self-assembly. The comparison with a similar [MASK], the Alzheimer [MASK] Aß(1-40), which is leading to self-assembly induced aggregation and amyloid deposits as well, reveals that in both [MASK]s highly homologous areas exist (Q10-?L16 and N21-L27 in hIAPP and Q15-A21 and S26-I32 in Aß). The N-terminal area of hIAPP around amino acid residues 3-20 displays large differences in pressure sensitivity compared to Aß, pinpointing to a different structural ensemble in this sequence element which is of helical origin in hIAPP. Knowledge of the structural nature of the highly amyloidogenic hIAPP and the differences with respect to the conformational ensemble of Aß(1-40) will help to identify molecular determinants of self-assembly as well as cross-seeded assembly initiated aggregation and help facilitate the rational design of drugs for therapeutic use.

      "[CLS] INTRODUCTION: The diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) refers to cognitive impairment not meeting dementia criteria. A survey among members of the American Association of Neurology (AAN) showed that MCI was considered a useful diagnosis. [MASK] research criteria have been proposed for the diagnosis of Alzheimers disease (AD) in MCI based on AD biomarkers (prodromal AD/MCI due to AD). The aim of this study was to investigate the attitudes of clinicians in Europe on the clinical utility of MCI and prodromal AD/MCI due to AD criteria. We also investigated whether the prodromal AD/MCI due to AD criteria impacted management of MCI patients. METHODS: An online survey was performed in 2015 among 102 members of the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) and the European Alzheimers Disease Consortium (EADC). Questions were asked on how often criteria were used, how they were operationalized, how they changed patient management, and what were considered advantages and limitations of MCI and prodromal AD/MCI due to AD. The questionnaire consisted of 47 questions scored on a Likert scale. RESULTS: Almost all respondents (92%) used the MCI diagnosis in clinical practice. Over 80% of the EAN/EADC respondents found a MCI diagnosis useful because it helped to label the cognitive problem, involve patients in planning for the future, and start risk reduction activities. These findings were similar  to those reported in the AAN survey. Research criteria for prodromal AD/MCI due to AD were used by 68% of the EAN/EADC respondents. The most common reasons to use the criteria were increased certainty of diagnosis (86%), increased possibilities to provide counseling (51%), facilitation of follow-up planning (48%), start of medical intervention (49%), and response to patients wish for a  diagnosis (41%). Over 70% of the physicians considered that a diagnosis of prodromal AD/MCI due to AD had an added value over the MCI diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic criteria of MCI and prodromal AD/MCI due to AD are commonly used among EAN/EADC members. The prodromal AD/MCI due to AD were considered clinically useful and impacted patient management and communication. [SEP]\t\tRecently,\n",

      "[CLS] Alzheimers disease (AD) is associated with multifactorial neuropathological conditions, which include cholinergic deficit, amyloid-beta plaques formation, loss of neuronal plasticity and neuronal death. Treating such multifactorial conditions with a single target directed approach is considered to be inadequate. Accordingly, multi-target directed ligand (MTDL) strategy has been evolved as an  auspicious approach for the treatment of AD. In light of that, a library of 2-substituted benzo[d]oxazol-5-amine derivatives (29-39; 86-107) was designed using the scaffold hopping guided MTDLs strategy, synthesized and evaluated through various in-vitro and in-vivo biological studies. The optimal compound 92  exhibited potent inhibitory activities against AChE (IC50 = 0.052?±?0.010?µM), BuChE (IC50 = 1.085?±?0.035?µM), and significant amyloid-beta aggregation (20?µM) inhibition. The compound possessed better blood-brain barrier permeability (Pe?=?10.80?±?0.055?×?10-6?cm?s-1) in PAMPA assay and neuro protective properties (40?µM) on SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell lines. Furthermore, in-vivo behavioural studies [MASK] performed on Y-maze test (scopolamine-induced amnesia model) and Morris water maze test (Aß1-42 induced ICV rat model). The compound 92, at a dose of 10?mg/kg oral administration, demonstrated a substantial improvement of the cognitive and special memory impairment. In summary, both in-vitro and in-vivo investigations evidenced that compound 92 was a potential lead for the discovery  of safe and effective disease-modifying agents for AD. [SEP]\t\twere\n",

      "[CLS] Background: Negative attitudes toward dementia can delay care and diagnosis, increase social isolation, and limit recognition of the positive attributes of people living with dementia. The purpose of this project was to explore whether Dementia Friends sessions affected attitudes toward people living with dementia.  Dementia Friends is a program which includes basic information about dementia that was developed by the Alzheimers Society in the United Kingdom and is now offered in the United States. Participants: For this study, 101 adults ages 18 years and older were recruited from local universities and the surrounding community in northern Minnesota. The participants were asked to participate in a  one-hour Dementia Friends information session and complete the Dementia Attitudes Scale (DAS) [MASK] before and after the session. The sample was divided into two sectors (university student or non-student). Results: Eighty participants completed the DAS, and statistically significant positive changes occurred in pre and posttest scores. Both social comfort and dementia knowledge, the two factors  measured by the DAS, showed statistically significant positive increases. No correlations were observed between the mean score change and age or sector. Implications: These findings suggest that participation in Dementia Friends information sessions can positively affect participants attitudes toward dementia. [SEP]\t\timmediately\n",

      "[CLS] Introduction: Culturally fair cognitive assessments sensitive to detecting changes associated with prodromal Alzheimers disease are needed. Methods: Performance of Hispanic and non-Hispanic older adults on the Loewenstein-Acevedo Scale of Semantic Interference and Learning (LASSI-L) was examined in persons with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) or normal cognition. The association between a novel cognitive marker, the failure to recover from proactive semantic interference (frPSI), and cortical thinning was explored. Results: English-speaking aMCI participants scored lower than cognitively normal  participants on all LASSI-L [MASK] while Spanish-speaking aMCI participants scored lower in learning, frPSI, and delayed recall. Healthy controls obtained equivalent scores on all indices except retroactive semantic interference. English-speaking and Spanish-speaking aMCI participants had equivalent scores except English speakers greater vulnerability to frPSI. Across aMCI groups, frPSI was associated with cortical thinning of the entorhinal cortex and precuneus (r = -0.45 to r = 0.52; P < .005). Discussion: In diverse populations, LASSI-L performance differentiated patients with aMCI from cognitively normal older adults and was associated with thinning in Alzheimers disease-prone regions, suggesting its clinical utility.

      "[CLS] INTRODUCTION: There is keen interest in elucidating the biological mechanisms underlying recent failures of ß-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme-1  (BACE1) inhibitors in Alzheimers disease trials. METHODS: We developed a highly sensitive and specific immunoassay for BACE1 in cell lines and iPSC-derived human neurons to systematically analyze the effects of eight clinically relevant BACE1 inhibitors. RESULTS: Seven of 8 inhibitors elevated BACE1 protein levels. Among protease inhibitors tested, the elevation was specific to BACE1 inhibitors. The inhibitors did not increase BACE1 transcription but extended the proteins half-life. BACE1  became elevated at concentrations below the [MASK] for amyloid ß (Aß). DISCUSSION: Elevation of BACE1 by 7 of 8 BACE1 inhibitors raises new concerns about advancing such ß-secretase inhibitors for AD. Chronic elevation could lead  to intermittently uninhibited BACE1 when orally dosed inhibitors reach trough levels, abnormally increasing substrate processing. Compounds such as roburic acid that lower Aß by dissociating ß/? secretase complexes are better candidates  because they neither inhibit ß- and ?-secretase nor increase BACE1 levels.

The aim of the present study was to detect whether increased inflammatory activity at baseline could predict cognitive and functional decline in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) or  AD dementia after 2 years. METHODS: Serum samples from 242 memory clinic patients with an aMCI (n=88) or AD  dementia (n=154) were analyzed for [MASK] protein and for 14 other inflammatory markers [interleukin (IL)-1ß, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p40, IL-17a, IL-18, IL-22, IL-33, tumor necrosis factor, cluster of differentiation 40 ligand, interferon-?, chemokine ligand (CCL) 2, and CCL4] by bead-based multiplex immunoassay. Disease progression was measured by the annual increase in the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) and annual decrease in the score on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). RESULTS: No association between increased levels of the inflammatory markers and  change on the CDR-SB or MMSE score was found, but there was a significant difference in baseline IL-6 and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist levels between  aMCI and AD dementia groups.

      "[CLS] OBJECTIVES: REM sleep without atonia (RSWA) is a polysomnographic finding used in diagnosis of REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD). Clinical significance of idiopathic RSWA (iRSWA) unaccompanied by RBD is not known. We designed a prospective study to investigate whether iRSWA constitutes an increased risk for  developing neurodegenerative disorders. MATERIALS & METHODS: Between January 2010 and December 2014, a total of 4,362 patients underwent a full-night video-polysomnography. Upon detailed clinical and polysomnographical examination, patients with iRSWA and idiopathic RBD (iRBD) were enrolled into this study, and followed-up six monthly for 4 years up to 9 years. RESULTS: We had a total of 31 patients with iRBD and 67 patients with iRSWA. Mean age was higher in iRBD group than those in iRSWA group (p=0.016). Restless Legs Syndrome/Willis-Ekbom Disease was significantly more common in patients with iRBD than those in patient with iRSWA (p<0.001). Eighteen patients with iRSWA (26.8%)  developed iRBD after 2.6+2.2 years. Six patients with iRSWA (8.9%) developed neurodegenerative disorders following 2.4+1.5 years; four were diagnosed as Parkinsons disease (PD) and two developed probable Alzheimer-type dementia. In patients with iRBD, 8 patients (25.8%) developed neurodegenerative disorders -all was Parkinsons disease- following 2.6+2.2 years. Development of neurodegenerative diseases was positively correlated with age (p<0.001) and [MASK] leg movements in sleep in both groups (p<0.010). CONCLUSIONS: These results show that iRSWA may also be accepted as a risk factor  in the development of PD or neurodegenerative diseases.

METHODS: The cost-effectiveness analysis was based on the data of 444 patients of a cluster-randomized, controlled trial, conceptualized to evaluate a collaborative DCM that aimed to optimize treatment and care in dementia. Health-care resource use, costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost per QALY gained were measured over a 24-month time horizon. RESULTS: DCM increased QALYs (+0.05) and decreased costs (-569€) due to a lower hospitalization and a delayed institutionalization (7 months) compared with usual care. The probability of DCM being cost-effective was 88% at willingness-to-pay thresholds of 40,000€ per QALY gained and higher in patients living alone compared to those not living alone (96% vs. 26%). DISCUSSION: DCM is likely to be a cost-effective strategy in treating dementia and thus beneficial for public health-care payers and patients, especially for those living alone. [SEP]\t\tstudy\n",

      "[CLS] Brain amyloid deposits have been identified as the main neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimers diseases (AD) and intensive efforts have been devoted to develop aggregation inhibitors preventing the formation of toxic oligomeric Aß for therapeutic. In addition, evidence indicates that the formation and accumulation of ß-amyloid plaques probably precede clinical symptoms by around 20 years and imaging of such plaques would be beneficial for early-stage AD detection. In this study, we investigated phenothiazine-based compounds as novel  promising theranostic agents for AD. These multifunctional agents exhibited BBB permeability, low neurotoxicity, good bio-stability as well as strong turn-on fluorescence with a Stokes shift upon binding to Aß aggregates. They had metal-chelating property which could delay Aß aggregation and displayed high binding affinity for ß-amyloid aggregates. Moreover, they have been simultaneously applied to perform in vivo near-infrared fluorescence imaging of ß-amyloid plaques in double transgenic AD mouse model, to prevent self-aggregation of Aß monomer from forming toxic oligomers and to protect human  neuroblastoma [MASK] cells against Aß-induced toxicity and oxidative stress.

METHODS: [MASK] included participants with late mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at baseline from the Japanese Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (J-ADNI) study. [MASK] imputed normalized and Z-transformed structural volume or cortical thickness data of 164 parcellated brain regions/structures based on the calculations of the FreeSurfer software.

RESULTS: [MASK] included 204 participants from the baseline dataset, and performed a  follow-up with 100 in the 36-month dataset of MCI cohort participants from the J-ADNI. In the univariate correlation or variable importance analysis, baseline atrophy in temporal lobe regions/structures significantly predicted clinical AD progression. In the WGCNA consensus analysis, co-atrophy modules associated with  MCI conversion were first distributed in the temporal lobe and subsequently extended to adjacent parietal cortical regions in the following 36?months. CONCLUSIONS: [MASK] identified coordinated modules of brain atrophy and demonstrated  their longitudinal extension along with the clinical course of AD progression using WGCNA, which showed a good correspondence with previous pathological studies of the tau propagation theory.

      "[CLS] Neuropathological diagnostic criteria of neurodegenerative disorders are based on the presence of specific inclusions in a specific area of brain tissue that correlate with clinical manifestations. Concomitant neurodegenerative disorders correspond to a combination of two (or more) different fully developed diseases in the same patient. Concomitant neurodegenerative pathology represents the presence of definite neurodegeneration and deposits of pathological proteins specific for another disease, which is not, however, fully developed. Very frequent overlaps include Alzheimers disease and alpha-synuclein inclusions. Nevertheless, careful neuropathological investigations reveal an increasing frequency of different co-pathologies in examined brains. In Alzheimers disease, protein TDP-43 may co-aggregate, but it is not clear whether this is atypical isolated Alzheimers disease or overlap of Alzheimers disease with early [MASK] lobar degeneration. Comorbidities of Alzheimers disease and tauopathies are relatively rare.

For example, neuronal injury, which correlates with cognitive decline in AD, can be assessed by [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission-tomography (FDG-PET), structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and total tau in cerebrospinal fluid  (CSFt-tau), all according to the A/T/N-classification. The aim of this study was  to calculate residual cognitive performance based on neuronal injury biomarkers as a surrogate of cognitive reserve, and to test the predictive value of this index for the individual clinical course. METHODS: 110 initially mild cognitive impaired and demented subjects (age [MASK] with a final diagnosis of AD dementia were assessed at baseline by  clinical mini-mental-state-examination (MMSE), FDG-PET, MRI and CSFt-tau. All neuronal injury markers were tested for an association with clinical MMSE and the resulting residuals were correlated with years of education. We used multiple regression analysis to calculate the expected MMSE score based on neuronal injury biomarkers and covariates. The residuals of the partial correlation for each biomarker and the predicted residualized memory function were correlated with individual cognitive changes measured during clinical follow-up (27?±?13?months). RESULTS: FDG-PET correlated highly with clinical MMSE (R?=?-0.49, p?<?.01), whereas hippocampal atrophy to MRI (R?=?-0.15, p?=?.14) and CSFt-tau (R?=?-0.12,  p?=?.22) showed only weak correlations. Residuals of all neuronal injury biomarker regressions correlated significantly with education level, indicating them to be surrogates of cognitive reserve. A positive residual was associated with faster cognitive deterioration at follow-up for the residuals of stand-alone FDG-PET (R?=?-0.36, p?=?.01) and the combined residualized memory function model  (R?=?-0.35, p?=?.02). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that subjects with higher cognitive reserve had accumulated more pathology, which subsequently caused a faster cognitive decline over time. Together with previous findings suggesting that higher reserve is associated with slower cognitive decline, we propose a biphasic reserve effect, with an initially protective phase followed by more rapid decompensation  once the protection is overwhelmed.

We studied medial temporal brain atrophy by magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI) and a set of lipid peroxidation biomarkers from plasma samples, respectively. The participants were AD patients in early stages (n?=?80) and healthy controls (n?=?32). Some lipid peroxidation compounds (neuroprostanes, isoprostanes, neurofurans, isofurans, 17-epi-17-F2t-dihomo-IsoP, PGF2a) in plasma showed statistically significant correlation with medial temporal atrophy. So, they were selected to generate an AD diagnosis model, showing an AUC-ROC of 0.900, close to accuracy achieved by the model based on neuroimaging analysis (AUC-ROC 0.929). In addition, the new model showed suitable specificity, so it could be used as screening test.

Although several serum analytes did not display changes, Interleukin-6 (IL-6) was found to be significantly increased in  both-mouse and human neural material. This demonstrates that acitretin exerts an  immune stimulatory effect-besides the alpha-secretase induction-which could impact the alleviation of learning and memory disabilities observed in the mouse  model.

      "[CLS] Alzheimers disease (AD) in the elderly is frequently accompanied by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH), which impairs the clearance of amyloid beta (Aß) due to the dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and accelerates the AD pathology. Since the coagulation and complement cascades are associated [MASK] BBB  dysfunction and AD pathology, we investigated the expression changes of coagulation (fibrinogen alpha chain-FGA, coagulation factor XIII A chain-Factor XIIIa) and complement (plasma protease C1 inhibitor-C1-INH, Complement component  3-C3) factors in the brain of novel AD model (APP23) mice [MASK] CCH at 12?months of age. Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent analysis showed that the expressions of FGA, Factor XIIIa, C1-INH and C3 were significantly increased in cerebral neocortex, hippocampus, and thalamus of APP23?+?CCH group (n?=?12) as compared [MASK] wild type (WT, n?=?10) and APP23 (n?=?10) groups (?P?<?.05 and ??P?<?.01 vs WT; #P?<?.05 and P?<?.01 vs APP23), especially near and inside of  neurovascular unit. The present study suggests that CCH activated both the coagulation and complement cascades in a novel AD model mice brain accompanied by the acceleration of AD pathology. [SEP]\t\twith\n",

We hypo[MASK]sized that CaN activation is involved in [MASK] inflammatory changes observed in [MASK] streptozotocin (STZ)-induced model of AD. We investigated hippocampal inflammatory and CaN changes in Wistar rats in two moments after intracerebroventricular STZ administration: in [MASK] first week (early) and fourth  week (later on). We found an early (at 1 week) and persistent (at fourth week) increment in [MASK] subunit A of CaN, as well as an increase in [MASK] major 48 kDa fragment of this subunit. Glial and inflammatory activation were confirmed by changes of IBA-1, TLR-4, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and S100B in [MASK] hippocampus.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Relationships between brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), aldosterone, and cognition in aging were evaluated in the population-based Epidemiology of Hearing Loss Study (1993 to present). METHODS: Beginning in 1998 to 2000, cognitive impairment was [MASK] by report of physician diagnoses and the Mini-Mental State Examination. In 2009 to 2010 and 2013 to 2016, information was collected on diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment/dementia. Decline in cognitive function was [MASK] by principal component analysis from additional tests administered during 2009 to 2010 and 2013 to 2016. BDNF, IGF-1, and aldosterone were measured in serum collected in 1998 to 2000. RESULTS: There were 1970 participants (mean age=66.9?y; 59.1% female) without cognitive impairment at baseline. Among women, low BDNF was associated with 16-year incident cognitive impairment [hazard ratio=1.76; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.04, 2.98]. Among men, increasing IGF-1 was associated with decreased risk  [per SD: relative risk (RR)=0.57; 95% CI=0.35, 0.92], whereas increasing aldosterone levels were associated with increased risk (per SD: RR=1.28; 95% CI=1.01, 1.62) for 5-year incident mild cognitive impairment/dementia. Overall, low BDNF was associated with increased risk (RR=1.52; 95% CI=1.02, 2.26) for 5-year cognitive decline. CONCLUSION: Low levels of serum BDNF and IGF-1 were associated with poorer cognition during aging. There may be differential biomarker effects by sex. [SEP]\t\tassessed\n",

      "[CLS] Alzheimers disease (AD) is one of the most common forms of dementia and has been a global concern for several years. Due to the multifactorial nature of the disease, AD has become irreversible, fatal and imposes a tremendous socio-economic burden. Even though experimental medicines suggested moderate benefits, AD still lacks an effective treatment strategy for the management of symptoms or cure. Among various hypothesises that describe the development and progression of AD, the amyloid hypothesis has been a long-term adherent to the AD due to the involvement of various forms of amyloid beta (Aß) peptides in the impairment of neuronal and cognitive functions. Hence, the majority of the drug discovery approaches in the past have focused on preventing the accumulation of Aß peptides. Currently, there are several agents in the phase III clinical [MASK] that target Aß or the various macromolecules triggering Aß deposition.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: The pathological impact of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) on Alzheimers disease (AD) is still poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated the role of CCH on an AD mouse model in phosphorylated tau and a-synuclein pathology, neurovascular unit, cerebrovascular remodeling, and neurovascular trophic coupling. Moreover, examined protective effect of a new antioxidant Twendee X (TwX). METHODS: APP23 mice were implanted to bilateral common carotid arteries stenosis  with ameroid constrictors to gradually decrease the cerebral blood flow. The effects of the administration of TwX were evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis and Immunofluorescent histochemistry. RESULTS: The present study revealed that the expressions of phospho-tau and phospho-a-synuclein were significantly increased in the APP23?+?CCH mice group as compared with wild type and APP23 mice groups (*P < .05 and ??P < .01 versus WT;  #P < .05 and P < .01 versus APP23). In addition, CCH significantly exacerbated  MMP-9 activation relating to blood-brain barrier destruction (??P < .01 versus WT; #P < .05, and P < .01 versus APP23), enhanced neurovascular remodeling, and impaired a neurovascular trophic coupling in the vascular endothelial BDNF expression of the APP23?+?CCH group. TwX treatment (20 mg/kg/day, from 4.5 to 12  months) significantly reduced tau and a-synuclein pathologies, ameliorated neurovascular [MASK] compared with APP23?+?CCH group. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that administration of a new antioxidative mixture TwX substantially reduced the above neuropathologic abnormalities, suggesting a potential therapeutic benefit of TwX for AD with CCH.

      "[CLS] INTRODUCTION: Dementia (particularly Alzheimers disease, AD) is a major cause of impaired cognitive functions in the elderly. Amnestic mild cognitive impairment ([MASK]) is a prodromal stage of AD, if substantiated by Alzheimer biomarkers. A neuroscientific model of pathological ageing emphasises the loss of brain plasticity, sensorimotor capacities and subsequent cognitive decline. A mechanistic treatment targeting dysfunctional plastic changes associated with ageing should be efficacious in delaying AD. In this trial, we aim to evaluate the effectiveness of a newly developed sensorimotor training, delivered at home,  combined with personalised reinforcement, on the progression of [MASK]-related cognitive impairments. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In a randomised trial, we will compare two [MASK] groups (30  subjects each), randomly allocated to a sensorimotor or a cognitive control training. Both trainings consist of an adaptive algorithm, and will last 3?months each. We hypothesise that both trainings will have positive effects on cognitive  function with the sensorimotor training being superior compared with the control  training based on its improvement in basic perceptual skills underlying memory encoding and retrieval. The primary outcome is episodic memory function, improved hippocampal function during memory tasks will be a secondary outcome. As further  exploratory outcomes, we expect improved segregation in sensory and motor maps, better sensory discrimination only in the sensorimotor training and reduced transition to dementia (examined after completion of this study). We expect the experimental training to be evaluated more positively by the users compared with  the cognitive training, resulting in reduced rates of discontinuation. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, approved the study (2015-543N-MA), which adheres to the Declaration of Helsinki.

      "[CLS] Metals are involved in different pathophysiological mechanisms associated with neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), including Alzheimers disease (AD), Parkinsons disease (PD) and multiple sclerosis (MS). The aim of this study was to review the effects of the essential metals zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), manganese (Mn) and iron (Fe) on the central nervous system (CNS), as well as the mechanisms involved in their neurotoxicity. Low levels of Zn as well as high levels of Cu, Mn, and Fe participate in the activation of signaling pathways of the inflammatory, oxidative and nitrosative stress (IO&NS) response, including nuclear factor kappa B and activator protein-1. The imbalance of these metals impairs the structural, regulatory, and catalytic functions of different enzymes, proteins, receptors, and transporters. Neurodegeneration occurs via [MASK] of metals with proteins and subsequent induction of aggregate formation creating  a vicious cycle by disrupting mitochondrial function, which depletes adenosine triphosphate and induces IO&NS, cell death by apoptotic and/or necrotic mechanisms. In AD, at low levels, Zn suppresses ß-amyloid-induced neurotoxicity by selectively precipitating aggregation intermediates; however, at high levels,  the binding of Zn to ß-amyloid may enhance formation of fibrillar ß-amyloid aggregation, leading to neurodegeneration. High levels of Cu, Mn and Fe participate in the formation a-synuclein aggregates in intracellular inclusions,  called Lewy Body, that result in synaptic dysfunction and interruption of axonal  transport. In PD, there is focal accumulation of Fe in the substantia nigra, while in AD a diffuse accumulation of Fe occurs in various regions, such as cortex and hippocampus, with Fe marginally increased in the senile plaques. Zn deficiency induces an imbalance between T helper (Th)1 and Th2 cell functions and a failure of Th17 down-regulation, contributing to the pathogenesis of MS. In MS, elevated levels of Fe occur in certain brain regions, such as thalamus and striatum, which may be due to inflammatory processes disrupting the blood-brain barrier and attracting Fe-rich macrophages. Delineating the specific mechanisms by which metals alter redox homeostasis is essential to understand the pathophysiology of AD, PD, and MS and may provide possible new targets for their  prevention and treatment of the patients affected by these NDDs.

      "[CLS] Cystatin C (CysC) is implicated in neuroprotection and repair in the nervous system in response to diverse neurotoxic conditions. In addition to being secreted from cells in a soluble form, CysC is released [MASK] cells in association with extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes. We demonstrate that EVs containing CysC protect cultured cells from starvation-induced death. Moreover, while EVs secreted [MASK] CysC-deficient cells were not protective, EVs secreted [MASK] CysC-deficient cells treated with exogenous human CysC significantly enhanced the survival of the cells. CysC also plays a role in modulating the secretion of EVs, enhancing secretion of EVs [MASK] primary cortical neurons and primary cortical smooth muscle cells. Confirming these in vitro findings, higher EV levels were observed in the brain extracellular space of transgenic mice expressing human CysC as compared to littermate controls. Regulation of cell-secreted EV levels and content in the brain is likely to be essential to maintaining normal brain function. We propose that enhanced EV release could rescue the deleterious effects of dysfunction of the endosomal-lysosomal system in neurodegenerative disorders. Moreover, a higher level of CysC-loaded EVs released from cells in the central nervous system has important protective functions, representing a potential therapeutic tool for disorders of the central nervous system.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular conditions contribute to brain volume loss, reduced cerebrovascular health, and increased dementia risk in aging adults. Altered hippocampal connectivity has also been observed in individuals with cardiovascular conditions, yet the functional consequences of these changes remain unclear. In the present study, we collected functional magnetic resonance  imaging data during memory encoding and used a psychophysiological interaction analysis to examine whether cardiovascular burden, indexed using the Framingham risk score, was associated with encoding-related hippocampal connectivity and task performance in cognitively-intact older adults between 65 and 85 years of age. Our goal was to better understand the early functional consequences of vascular and metabolic dysfunction in [MASK] at risk for cognitive decline. RESULTS: High Framingham risk scores were associated with lower total brain volumes. In addition, [MASK] with high Framingham risk scores showed an altered relationship between left hippocampal-medial prefrontal coupling and task performance compared to [MASK] with low Framingham risk scores. Specifically, we found a significant interaction of Framingham risk and learning on connectivity between the left hippocampus and primarily left midline prefrontal regions comprising the left ventral anterior cingulate cortex and medial prefrontal cortex. Those with lower Framingham risk scores showed a pattern of weaker connectivity between left hippocampal and medial prefrontal regions associated with better task performance. Those with higher Framingham risk scores showed the opposite pattern; stronger connectivity was associated with better performance. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from the current study show that amongst older adults with  cardiovascular conditions, higher Framingham risk is associated with lower brain  volume and altered left hippocampal-medial prefrontal coupling during task performance compared to [MASK] with lower Framingham risk scores. This may reflect a compensatory mechanism in support of memory function and suggests that older adults with elevated cardiovascular risk are vulnerable to early Alzheimer disease-like dysfunction within the episodic memory system.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: CA1 subregion of the hippocampal formation is one of the primarily affected structures in AD, yet not much is known about proteome alterations in the extracellular milieu of this region. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to identify the protein expression alterations throughout the pre-pathological, progression and pathological stages of AD mouse  model. METHOD: The CA1 region perfusates were collected by in-vivo intracerebral push-pull perfusion [MASK] transgenic 5XFAD mice and their non-transgenic littermates at 3, 6 and 12 months of age. Morris water maze test and immunohistochemistry staining of Aß were performed to determine the stages of the disease in this mouse model. The protein expression differences were analyzed by  label-free shotgun proteomics analysis. RESULTS: A total of 251, 213 and 238 proteins were identified in samples obtained [MASK] CA1 regions of mice at 3, 6 and 12 months of age, respectively. Of these, 68, 41 and 33 proteins showed statistical significance. Pathway analysis based on the unique and common proteins within the groups revealed that several pathways are dysregulated during different stages of AD. The alterations in glucose and lipid metabolisms respectively in pre-pathologic and progression stages of the disease, lead to imbalances in ROS production via diminished SOD level and impairment of neuronal integrity. CONCLUSION: We conclude that CA1 region-specific proteomic analysis of hippocampal degeneration may be useful in identifying the earliest as well as progressional changes that are associated with Alzheimers disease.

      "[CLS] Proteolysis of amyloid-ß (Aß) is a promising approach against Alzheimers disease. However, it is not feasible to employ natural hydrolases directly because of their cumbersome preparation and purification, poor stability, and hazardous immunogenicity. Therefore, artificial enzymes have been developed as potential alternatives to natural hydrolases. Since [MASK] cleavage sites of Aß are usually embedded inside the ß-sheet structures that restrict access by artificial enzymes, this strongly hinders their efficiency for practical applications. Herein, we construct a NIR (near-IR) controllable artificial metalloprotease (MoS2 -Co) using a molybdenum disulfide nanosheet (MoS2 ) and a cobalt complex of 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (Codota). Evidenced by detailed experimental and theoretical studies, the NIR-enhanced MoS2 -Co can circumvent the restriction by simultaneously inhibition of ß-sheet formation and destroying ß-sheet structures of the preformed Aß aggregates in living cell.

We conducted systematic and  quantitative immunohistochemistry for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1), amyloid beta, and highly phosphorylated tau (tauopathy). White matter intactness was evaluated by myelin and axon staining in adjacent brain tissue sections. Eight of 15 cases (4 AD, 3 PD, and 1 NC) showed increased immunoreactivity for microglia and astrocytes in the white matter that connects striatum and cortex. Quantitative analysis of these 8 cases showed a significant negative correlation between GFAP (but not Iba-1) and myelin (but not axon) staining in white matter (r 2?=?0.78, p < 0.005). Tau, but not amyloid beta plaques, is significantly higher in AD vs. PD and NC. Tau burden increases with age in AD cases.

The effect of the extracts on ß-amyloid (Aß1-42 ) peptide were determined using electron microscope.

CONCLUSION: In U.S. adults aged 60 years or older, long nighttime weekday or workday sleep duration is associated with poorer verbal memory, semantic fluency, working memory, and processing speed in addition to greater odds of self-reported cognitive problems. Long sleep duration may be a marker of fragmented sleep or neurodegeneration in U.S. older adults. [SEP]\t\tauthors\n",

      "[CLS] Systems biology and systems neurophysiology generate comprehensive mechanistic models of the spatial-temporal evolution of body system networks from physiological to pathophysiological conditions. Alzheimers disease (AD)-related  pathophysiological alterations converge with overexpressed age-related functional decline, i.e. aging, which is induced by genetic- and stochastic time-dependent events. Accumulation of cellular senescence has a casual role in aging-related disease and senotherapeutic drugs have already shown encouraging results for counteracting the detrimental effect of senescence. However, the non-linear complex nature of AD pathophysiology calls for a systems-level integration of aging dynamics, from molecules until large-scale networks. We need a holistic systems-wide comprehensive model of aging which is constituted by a non-linear spatial-temporal weakening of adaptive responses resulting in the activation of compensatory mechanisms that ensure biological robustness, resilience, and finally preserve homeodynamics. After exceeding the threshold of compensated (resilient) aging, a cascade of decompensatory events occurs, ultimately triggering irreversible systems failure that, at some advanced stages, reflect widespread \"pathophysiological hallmarks of AD\". The gap in the comprehensive understanding of aging, resilience, and AD pathophysiological evolution will be filled through a quantitative, flexible, and integrative modeling approach to detect multiple spatial-temporal patterns and for dissecting causal mechanisms and downstream cascades throughout the aging-AD continuum. Novel technological and conceptual advances, will enable the systems-level integration of aging signatures as well as compensatory mechanisms that provide resilience to early functional decline. This will provide new systems-scaled outcomes and endpoints to map and [MASK] enhance resilience, accomplishing a long-lasting compensated aging. [SEP]\t\ttherapeutically\n",

Here we describe the  synthesis and multitarget biological profiling of a new class of compounds designed by molecular hybridization of an NMDA receptor antagonist fluorobenzohomoadamantanamine with the potent acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor 6-chlorotacrine, using two different linker lengths and linkage positions, to preserve or not the memantine-like polycyclic unsubstituted primary amine. The best hybrids exhibit greater potencies than parent compounds against AChE (IC50 0.33?nM in the best case, 44-fold increased potency over 6-chlorotacrine), butyrylcholinesterase (IC50 21?nM in the best case, 24-fold increased potency over 6-chlorotacrine), and NMDA receptors (IC50 0.89?µM in the  best case, 2-fold increased potency over the parent benzohomoadamantanamine and memantine), which suggests an additive effect of both pharmacophoric moieties in  the interaction with the primary targets.

METHODS: Negative binomial (NB) regressions were performed using gene expression  data accrued from a single population of CA1 pyramidal neurons and regional hippocampal dissections obtained from participants in the Rush Religious Orders Study (RROS). RESULTS: Downregulation of Bdnf is independently associated with increased entorhinal cortex NPs. Downregulation of [MASK] is independently associated with increased entorhinal cortex NFTs and CA1 NPs during the progression of AD.

METHODS: We included all patients over 49 years of age, hospitalized in France in 2008 (without dementia) and in 2014. Dependent variable was AD or AD dementia diagnosis in 2014. We recoded the diagnoses of hospital stays (in ICD-10) into 137 explanatory variables.To avoid overweighting the \"age\" variable, we divided the population into 7 sub-populations of 5 years. RESULTS: We analyzed [MASK] patients in the PMSI in 2008 and 2014: 55,997 patients had coding for AD or AD dementia in 2014 (4.04%). We associated Alzheimer disease in 2014 with about 20 variables including male sex, stroke, diabetes mellitus, mental retardation, bipolar disorder, intoxication, Parkinson  disease, depression, anxiety disorders, alcohol, undernutrition, fall and 3 less  explored variables: intracranial hypertension (odd radio [95% confidence interval]: 1.16 [1.12-1.20] in 70-80 years group), psychotic disorder (OR: 1.09 [1.07-1.11] in 70-75 years group) and epilepsy (OR: 1.06 [1.05-1.07] after 70 years). DISCUSSION: We analyzed 137 variables in the PMSI identified some well-known risk factors for AD, and highlighted a possible association with intracranial hypertension, which merits further investigation.

      "[CLS] Background: More than 1.3 million emergency department visits have been associated with adverse drug events (ADEs) in older adults. Increasing Alzheimers [MASK] (AD) prevalence in the geriatric population poses an additive risk of ADEs because of the array of psychotropic medications prescribed for AD patients. Scant research has been conducted at a nationwide level on psychotropic-related ADEs in this population. Objective: This study aimed to determine the incidence and economic burden of psychotropic ADEs in the geriatric AD population compared with the non-AD geriatric population. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted of geriatric AD patients who visited the ED  in 2013 with a psychotropic-related ADE to determine the incidence and resource utilization of these events. The relationship between presence of AD and an ADE was analyzed using multiple logistic regression. Results: There were 427 969 Alzheimers ED visits compared with 20 492 554 ED visits without. Of the AD cases, 1.04% were associated with at least 1 adverse event. AD cases more frequently were admitted as inpatients (64.90% vs 34.92%, P < 0.01). Common drug  classes associated with AD-related ADEs were benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, and autonomic nervous system-affecting agents (adrenergic agonists, antimuscarinic agents, anticholinergic agents). There was a significantly higher likelihood for  Alzheimers cases to experience any psychotropic-related adverse event (OR = 1.66; 95% CI = 1.20, 1.82). Conclusion and Relevance: Alzheimers patients more frequently experienced psychotropic-related adverse events and related adverse outcomes than older adults without Alzheimers. Application of these findings should be implemented in protocol development to reduce future psychotropic-related adverse outcomes for this population. [SEP]\t\tdisease\n",

      "[CLS] AIM: Alzheimers disease is a common cause of dementia, and is usually treated with medications that elevate acetylcholine levels. The objective of the present  study was to identify drugs with anticholinergic properties prescribed to patients diagnosed with Alzheimers disease in Colombia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out in outpatients diagnosed with Alzheimers disease who were identified from a population database from Colombia, and had been treated with cholinesterase inhibitors and glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists. The anticholinergic burden was evaluated using the Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden scale, and patients were classified on a scale of 0-3?points according to anticholinergic potential, and were grouped into those with mild-to-moderate (1-2?points) or high [MASK] anticholinergic load. RESULTS: The study included 4134 Alzheimers disease patients. The mean age was 81.50?±?8.16?years, and 67.8% were women. At least 22.9% of patients took anticholinergic drugs. Of these, the most frequently prescribed medication was quetiapine (8.6%). Age >85?years was associated with a high risk of having an anticholinergic burden =3?points (OR 2.19, 95%CI 1.159-4.162). Potential interactions between cholinesterase inhibitors and anticholinergic drugs were identified in 7.8% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients who were prescribed anticholinergic drugs were older women, had a significant total anticholinergic burden and had frequent pharmacological interactions with cholinesterase inhibitors. The use of anticholinergics reduces the clinical effectiveness of antidementia drugs and increases the risk of adverse reactions. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2019; ••: ••-••. [SEP]\t\t(=3?points)\n",

      "[CLS] Purpose of Review: Agitation is common among older adults with dementia; its origin may be multi-factorial, and it is often difficult to treat. In this paper, we summarize current knowledge and offer considerations on pharmacologic management of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). Recent Findings: We reviewed human studies published from 2013 to 2018 evaluating pharmacologic management of BPSD manifestations including depressive symptoms, mania, psychosis, and other BPSD, as well as severe agitation without determination of underlying cause. After non-pharmacological management is exhausted, the choice of pharmacological options depends on patient comorbidities, specific BPSD presentation, and patient tolerance of medications. Summary: Depending on manifestations of BPSD, low- to moderate-quality [MASK] supports the use of anti-depressants, anti-psychotics, or anti-epileptics in conjunction with cholinesterase inhibitors.

Then we studied the gene expression network using the STRING database and identified the hub genes using Cytoscape. Furthermore, we analyzed the microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs  (lncRNAs), and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the AD-associated genes, and then identified feed-forward loops. Finally, we performed SNP analysis of the AD-associated genes. Our results identified 207 common DEGs, of which 57 have previously been reported to be associated with AD.  The common DEG expression network identified eight hub genes, all of which were previously known to be associated with AD. Further study of the regulatory miRNAs associated with the AD-associated genes and other genes specific to neurodegenerative diseases revealed 65 AD-associated miRNAs. Analysis of the miRNA associated transcription factor-miRNA-gene-gene associated TF (mTF-miRNA-gene-gTF) network around the AD-associated genes revealed 131 feed-forward loops (FFLs). Among them, one important FFL was found between the gene SERPINA3, hsa-miR-27a, and the transcription factor MYC. Furthermore, SNP analysis of the AD-associated genes identified 173 SNPs, and also found a role in AD for miRNAs specific to other neurodegenerative diseases, including hsa-miR-34c, hsa-miR-212, hsa-miR-34a, and hsa-miR-7.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria usually used in AD clinical trials were  applied. Principal component analysis and model-based clustering were used to identify cognitive profiles in a subset of patients with autopsy-verified AD (n = 800) and validated in the overall (nonautopsy) sample and an independent cohort with similar test data.

      "[CLS] Gamma oscillations (30-80?Hz) are fast network activity patterns frequently linked to cognition. They are commonly studied in hippocampal brain slices in vitro, where they can be evoked via pharmacological activation of various receptor families. One limitation of this approach is that neuronal activity is studied in a highly artificial extracellular fluid environment, as provided by artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF). Here, we examine the influence of human cerebrospinal fluid (hCSF) on kainate-evoked and spontaneous gamma oscillations in mouse hippocampus. We show that hCSF, as compared to aCSF of matched electrolyte and glucose composition, increases the power of kainate-evoked gamma  oscillations and induces spontaneous gamma activity in areas CA3 and CA1 that is  reversed by washout. Bath application of atropine entirely abolished hCSF-induced gamma oscillations, indicating critical contribution from muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-mediated signaling. In separate whole-cell patch clamp recordings from rat hippocampus, hCSF increased theta resonance frequency and [MASK] in pyramidal cells along with enhancement of h-current (Ih ) amplitude.

Objective: To examine whether physical [MASK] moderates the association of ß-amyloid (Aß) burden with longitudinal cognitive decline and neurodegeneration in clinically normal individuals and to examine whether these associations are independent of vascular risk. Design, Setting, and Participants: This longitudinal observational study included clinically normal participants from the Harvard Aging Brain Study. Participants were required to have baseline Aß positron emission tomography data, baseline medical data to quantify vascular risk, and longitudinal neuropsychological and structural magnetic resonance imaging data. Data were collected from April 2010 to June 2018. Data were analyzed from August to December 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Baseline physical [MASK] was quantified with a pedometer (mean steps per day). Baseline Aß burden was measured with carbon 11-labeled Pittsburgh Compound B positron emission tomography. Cognition was measured annually with the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (PACC; median [interquartile range] follow-up, 6.0 [4.3-6.3] years). Neurodegeneration was assessed with longitudinal structural magnetic resonance imaging (2 to 5 scans per participant; median [interquartile range] follow-up, 4.5 [3.0-5.0] years), with a focus on total gray matter volume and regional cortical thickness. Physical [MASK] and Aß burden were examined as interactive predictors of PACC decline and volume loss in separate linear mixed models, adjusting for age, sex,  education, apolipoprotein E e4 status, and, where appropriate, intracranial volume. Secondary models adjusted for vascular risk and its interaction with Aß burden. Results: Of the 182 included participants, 103 (56.6%) were female, and the mean  (SD) age was 73.4 (6.2) years. In models examining PACC decline and volume loss,  there was a significant interaction of physical [MASK] with Aß burden, such that greater physical [MASK] was associated with slower Aß-related cognitive decline (ß, 0.03; 95% CI, 0.02-0.05; P?<?.001) and volume loss (ß, 482.07; 95% CI, 189.40-774.74; P?=?.002). Adjusting for vascular risk did not alter these associations. In these models, lower vascular risk was independently associated with slower Aß-related PACC decline (ß, -0.04; 95% CI, -0.06 to -0.02; P?<?.001)  and volume loss (ß, -483.41; 95% CI, -855.63 to -111.20; P?=?.01). Conclusions and Relevance: Greater physical [MASK] and lower vascular risk independently attenuated the negative association of Aß burden with cognitive decline and neurodegeneration in asymptomatic individuals.

Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 72 adult male Wistar rats were used for behavioral and histopathologic studies. They were divided into nine groups included: control, negative control (Alzheimer), positive control ([MASK] treated with rivastigmine), aCSF (artificial cerebrospinal fluid) +  ziziphora extract with doses of 200,400, and 600 mg/kg, and STZ (stereptozotocine)+ziziphora extract in 200,400,600 mg/kg doses. The injury was created with bilaterally intraventricular injection. The spatial memory was studied by passive avoidance test and neuronal density was evaluated by dissector method. To examine the histopathological lesions, Congo red and toluidine blue staining were done. Data were analyzed by ANOVA Minitab software. Results: The memory index (neuronal density and passive avoidance test results) showed a significant decrease in negative control group compared to control (p=0.001). Treatment with the hydroalcoholic extract at the doses of 400 and 600  mg/kg showed a significant increase in memory index in rats with [MASK] disease (p=0.001). The effect of 200 mg/kg extract was not significantly different from that of the negative control group. The results of histological analysis indicated beta-amyloid plaques formation in the control group as compared to the negative control group while treatment with the extract at the doses of 400 and 600 mg/kg, significantly reduced beta-amyloid plaques formation. Conclusion: These findings suggest that the extract of Z. clinopodioides can improve [MASK] condition and alleviate memory and histopathologic damages; also, it decreases beta-amyloid plaques and apoptosis in CA1 region of the hippocampus.

In this study, we investigated the protein profiles in the hippocampus [MASK] the cerebral cortex of AD-related transgenic mouse model (3×Tg-AD) treated with memantine.

Morris water maze method and passive avoidance experiment were used to evaluate the memory ability of mice. The thiazole blue (MTT) method and the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) cytotoxicity test kit were used to evaluate the effect of emodin on the cell viability of hippocampal neurons in [MASK] mice treated with ß-amyloid peptide 1-42 (Aß1-42). The effect of emodin on PKC levels was explored using the modified Takai method and Western blotting. Behavioral test results showed that the escape latency of the mice in the model group was longer than that in the control group  (P&lt;0.05), and the escape latency was significantly shortened given a emodin prognosis. The MTT and LDH test results showed that emodin to Aß- overexpression  induced the protective effect of hippocampus cells in [MASK] mice. Western blot analysis showed that the phosphorylation level of PKC in mice increased significantly after emodin administration.

Accordingly, drugs that positively influence mitochondrial function are being evaluated in delay-of-onset clinical trials with at-risk individuals. Such ongoing clinical research can be advanced by developing a better understanding of how these drugs affect intermediate brain phenotypes associated with both AD risk and pathophysiology. Methods: Using a randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled design in 55 healthy elderly volunteers, we explored the effects of oral, low-dose [MASK] a thiazolidinedione with promitochondrial effects, on hippocampal activity measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging during the encoding  of novel face-name pairs.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Recent studies have revealed that vitamin D deficiency may increase the risk of Alzheimers disease, and vitamin D supplementation may be effective strategy to ameliorate the neurodegenerative process in Alzheimers disease patients. Paricalcitol (PAL), a low-calcemic vitamin D receptor agonist, is clinically used to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism. However, the potential application of PAL for treating neurodegenerative disorders remains unexplored. METHODS: The APP/PS1 mice were intraperitoneally injected with PAL or vehicle every other day for 15?weeks. The ß-amyloid (Aß) production was confirmed using immunostaining and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The underlying mechanism was verified by western blot and immunostaining in vivo and in vitro. FINDINGS: Long-term PAL treatment clearly reduced ß-amyloid (Aß) generation and neuronal loss in APP/PS1 transgenic mouse brains. PAL stimulated the expression of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) possibly through inhibiting sterol regulatory element binding protein-2 (SREBP2); PAL also promoted LRP1-mediated ß-site APP cleavage enzyme 1 (BACE1) transport to late endosomes, thus increasing the lysosomal degradation of BACE1. Furthermore, PAL diminished 8-hydroxyguanosine (8-OHdG) generation in neuronal mitochondria via enhancing base [MASK] repair (BER), resulting in the attenuation of calpain-1-mediated neuronal loss. INTERPRETATION: The present data demonstrate that PAL can reduce Aß generation through accelerating BACE1 lysosomal degradation and can inhibit neuronal loss through suppressing mitochondrial 8-OHdG generation. Hence, PAL might be a promising agent for treating Alzheimers disease. FUND: This study was financially supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (U1608282). [SEP]\t\texcision\n",

      "[CLS] The microglial receptors CD33 and TREM2 have been associated with risk for Alzheimers disease (AD). Here, we investigated crosstalk between CD33 and TREM2. We showed that knockout of CD33 attenuated amyloid beta (Aß) pathology and improved cognition in 5xFAD [MASK] both of which were abrogated by additional TREM2 knockout. Knocking out TREM2 in 5xFAD mice exacerbated Aß pathology and neurodegeneration but reduced Iba1+ cell numbers, all of which could not be rescued by additional CD33 knockout. RNA-seq profiling of microglia revealed that genes related to phagocytosis and signaling (IL-6, IL-8, acute phase response) are upregulated in 5xFAD;CD33-/- and downregulated in 5xFAD;TREM2-/- mice. Differential gene expression in 5xFAD;CD33-/- microglia depended on the presence  of TREM2, suggesting TREM2 acts downstream of CD33. Crosstalk between CD33 and TREM2 includes regulation of the IL-1ß/IL-1RN axis and a gene set in the \"receptor activity chemokine\" cluster.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Processing of degraded speech is a promising model for understanding  communication under challenging listening [MASK] core auditory deficits and  residual capacity for perceptual learning and cerebral plasticity in major dementias. METHODS: We compared the processing of sine-wave-degraded speech in 26 patients with primary progressive aphasia (non-fluent, semantic, and logopenic variants),  10 patients with typical Alzheimers disease and 17 healthy control subjects. Participants were required to identify sine-wave words that were more predictable (three-digit numbers) or less predictable (place names). The change in identification performance within each session indexed perceptual learning. Neuroanatomical associations of degraded speech processing were assessed using voxel-based morphometry. RESULTS: Patients with non-fluent and logopenic progressive aphasia and typical Alzheimers disease showed impaired identification of sine-wave numbers, whereas  all syndromic groups showed impaired identification of sine-wave place names. A significant overall identification advantage for numbers over place names was shown by patients with typical Alzheimers disease, patients with semantic progressive aphasia and healthy control participants. All syndromic groups showed spontaneous perceptual learning effects for sine-wave numbers. For the combined patient cohort, grey matter correlates were identified across a distributed left  hemisphere network extending beyond classical speech-processing cortices. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate resilience of auditory perceptual learning capacity across dementia syndromes, despite variably impaired perceptual decoding of degraded speech and reduced predictive integration of semantic knowledge. This work has implications for the neurobiology of dynamic sensory processing and plasticity in neurodegenerative diseases and for development of novel biomarkers and therapeutic interventions.

We identified a cortex-specific hypo-metabolic signature at symptomatic onset and a cortex-specific hyper-metabolic signature of Lands cycle glycerophosphocholine remodeling over the course of progressive behavioral decline. When N5 TgCRND8 and ?ßPPS we /PSIdE9 mice first exhibited deficits in the Morris Water Maze, levels of lyso-phosphatidylcholines, LPC(18:0/0:0), [MASK] LPC(24:6/0:0), LPC(25:6/0:0), the lyso-platelet-activating factor (PAF), LPC(O-18:0/0:0), and the PAF, PC(O-22:6/2:0), declined as a result of reduced calcium-dependent cytosolic phospholipase A2 a (cPLA2 a) activity in all cortices but not hippocampus. Chronic intermittent hypoxia, an environmental risk factor that triggers earlier learning memory impairment in ?ßPPS we /PSIdE9 mice, elicited these same metabolic changes in younger animals. Thus, this lipidomic signature of phenoconversion appears age-independent. By contrast, in symptomatic N5 TgCRND8 mice, cPLA2 a activity progressively increased; overall Lyso-phosphatidylcholines (LPC) and LPC(O) and PC(O-18:1/2:0) levels progressively rose. Enhanced cPLA2 a activity was only detected in transgenic mice; however, age-dependent increases in the PAF acetylhydrolase 1b a1 to a2 expression ratio, evident in both transgenic and non-transgenic mice, reduced PAF hydrolysis thereby contributing to PAF accumulation.

METHODS: We utilized the medical database of the Clalit-Health-Services in a case-control study. Patients with SSc were compared with age- and sex-matched controls with regard to the prevalence of AD and its impact on their mortality. RESULTS: Our study included 2,431 SSc patients and 12,377 age- and sex-matched controls. The mean age of the study population was 63.32±18.06 years and the female to male ratio was 4.5:1. 134 (5.5%) cases had AD as a co-morbidity in comparison with 749 (5.9%) of the controls. The mortality rate was 12.5% among controls and 26.2% among SSc cases. On the Cox multivariate survival analysis, diagnosis of SSc and AD demonstrated significant HRs (2.35 (95% CI 2.05-2.69, p < 0.0001) and 2.19 (95% CI 1.94-2.48, p < 0.0001), respectively).

      "[CLS] The underlying pathophysiology of chronic fatigue syndrome remains incompletely understood and there are no curative treatments for this disorder at present. However, increasing neuroimaging evidence indicates that functional and structural abnormalities exist in the brains of chronic fatigue syndrome patients, suggesting that the central nervous system is involved in this disorder and that at least some chronic fatigue syndrome patients may have an underlying neurological basis for their illness. In the present paper, we speculate that glymphatic dysfunction, causing toxic build up within the central nervous system, may be responsible for at least some cases of chronic fatigue syndrome. We [MASK] postulate that cerebrospinal fluid diversion such as lumboperitoneal shunting may be beneficial to this subgroup of patients by restoring glymphatic transport and waste removal from the brain. Although recent evidence indicates that at least some chronic fatigue syndrome patients may benefit from cerebrospinal fluid drainage, [MASK] studies are needed to confirm this finding  and to determine whether this can be attributed to enhancement of glymphatic fluid flow and interstitial fluid clearance. If confirmed, this could offer promising avenues for the future treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome. Clearly,  given the relative invasive nature of cerebrospinal fluid diversion, such procedures should be reserved for chronic fatigue syndrome patients who are severely debilitated, or for those with severe headaches.

It is currently unclear to what extent these hallmarks associate with symptoms of disease at extreme ages. Forty centenarians from the 100-plus Study cohort donated their brain. Centenarians self-reported to be cognitively healthy at baseline, which was confirmed by a proxy. Objective ante-mortem measurements of cognitive performance were associated with the prevalence, distribution and quantity of age- and AD-related neuropathological hallmarks. Despite self-reported cognitive health, objective neuropsychological testing suggested varying levels of ante-mortem cognitive functioning. Post-mortem, we found that neuropathological hallmarks related to age and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Aß and Tau pathology, as well as atherosclerosis, were abundantly present in most or all centenarians, whereas Lewy body and pTDP-43 pathology were scarce. We observed that increased pathology loads correlated across pathology subtypes, and an overall trend of higher pathology loads to associate with a lower cognitive test performance. This trend was carried especially by the presence of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and granulovacuolar degeneration (GVD) and to a lesser extent by Aß-associated pathologies. Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy (CAA) specifically associated with lower executive functioning in the centenarians.

      "[CLS] INTRODUCTION: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have become the first choice medical  treatment of acid-related disease and, as with any pharmacological agent, they have been reported to be [MASK] with some adverse events mainly linked to their chronic use. The most important postulated harms are represented by serum electrolyte alterations, vitamin B12 and iron deficiency, gastric tumors, enteric infections, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, pneumonia, ischemic heart attacks, bone fractures, chronic kidney disease, dementia, and Alzheimer disease. Specific pathophysiological mechanisms have been identified for some of them and not for other manifestations. AREAS COVERED: However, studies on PPIs safety have generally important limitations because of their frequent retrospective design and other methodological drawbacks, such as patients selection and residual confounders. EXPERT OPINION: Obviously, in the vast majority of the cases, adverse drug reactions cannot be assessed by means of randomized clinical trials due to the high costs, ethical reasons, and difficulties in performing prospective observational studies. So far, assessment of retrospective observational investigations remains the only method to evaluate adverse events with any drug in general and, although the weaknesses of these studies are evident, the awareness of the reported associations with the medications analyzed is important for physicians in order to manage adequately their individual patients.

      "[CLS] Amyloid imaging is a valuable tool for research and diagnosis in dementing disorders. Successful use of this tool is limited by the lack of a common standard in the quantification of amyloid imaging data. The Centiloid approach was recently proposed to address this problem and in this work, we report our implementation of this approach and evaluate the impact of differences in underlying image analysis methodologies using both cross-sectional and longitudinal datasets. The Centiloid approach successfully converts quantitative  amyloid burden measurements into a common Centiloid scale (CL) and comparable dynamic range. As expected, the Centiloid values derived from different analytical approaches inherit some of the inherent benefits and drawbacks of the  underlying approaches, and these differences result in statistically significant  (p?<?0.05) differences in the variability and group mean values. Because of these differences, even after expression in CL, the 95% specificity amyloid positivity  thresholds derived from different analytic approaches varied from 5.7 CL to 11.9  CL, and the reliable worsening threshold varied from -2.0 CL to 11.0 CL. Although this difference is in part due to the dependency of the threshold determination methodology on the statistical characteristics of the measurements. When amyloid  measurements obtained from different centers are combined for analysis, [MASK] should not expect Centiloid conversion to eliminate all the differences in amyloid burden measurements due to variabilities in underlying acquisition protocols and analysis techniques.

In this study, by crossing hAPP (human [MASK] precursor protein)-J20 mice with a line of GFAP-TK mice, we found that astrocytes were activated specifically at an early stage of AD before  the occurrence of [MASK] plaques, while microglia were not affected by this crossing.

The reprogramming activity of Ptf1a depends on its Notch-independent interaction with Rbpj which leads to subsequent activation  of expression of TF genes and Notch signaling required for NSC specification, self-renewal, and homeostasis.

[MASK] still remains a grand challenging task in building a simple, conventional and low-cost SERS substrate with highly dense hotspots for improved sensitivity of the target analytes. Here, we report a very dexterous strategy to fabricate a distinctive SERS substrate with high density hotspots, using common adsorbent activated carbon (AC) as template to assemble silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs). [MASK] can be estimated that the enhancement effect of Ag NPs/AC composite is about 6.5-fold that of bare Ag NPs. Different from the resonant dyes, however, formaldehyde (FA) is a Raman-inactive molecule even though enhanced. Considering that, a novel method for quantitative analysis of FA using the Ag NPs/AC composite as SERS sensor has been developed, based on the catalytic effect of trace FA on the oxidation of malachite green (MG) through bromate under acidic condition. The change of MG from reduced form into oxidized leucomalachite green (LMG) results in the quench of Raman signals of MG, responding to 0.07 ppb FA that is about 2 orders of magnitude lower than the limit defined by the Nashs method as a standard procedure recommended in Europe, Japan and China. Moreover, SERS examinations of endogenous FA in human urine signify that the proposed method has high selectivity, reliability and accuracy.

      "[CLS] Chronic neuro[MASK] is a hallmark of the onset and progression of brain proteinopathies such as Alzheimer disease (AD) and it is suspected to participate in the neurodegenerative process. Transcription factor NRF2, a master regulator of redox homeostasis, controls acute [MASK] but its relevance in low-grade  chronic [MASK] of AD is inconclusive due to lack of good mouse models. We have addressed this question in a transgenic mouse that combines amyloidopathy and tauopathy with either wild type (AT-NRF2-WT) or NRF2-deficiency (AT-NRF2-KO). AT-NRF2-WT mice died prematurely, at around 14 months of age, due to motor deficits and a terminal spinal deformity but AT-NRF2-KO mice died roughly 2 months earlier. NRF2-deficiency correlated with exacerbated astrogliosis and microgliosis, as determined by an increase in GFAP, IBA1 and CD11b levels. The immunomodulatory molecule dimethyl fumarate (DMF), a drug already used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis whose main target is accepted to be NRF2, was tested in this preclinical model. Daily oral gavage of DMF during six weeks reduced glial and inflammatory markers and improved cognition and motor complications in the AT-NRF2-WT mice compared with the vehicle-treated animals. This study demonstrates the relevance of the inflammatory response in experimental AD, tightly regulated by NRF2 activity, and provides a new strategy  to fight AD. [SEP]\t\tinflammation\n",

Non-neuronal microglial cells orchestrate neuroinflammatory reactions, and their  adverse activation has been linked to AD pathogenesis. Methyl jasmonate (MJ) has  anti-cancer properties and has also been shown to reduce peripheral inflammation  in pre-clinical models. Recently, anti-neuroinflammatory activity of MJ was demonstrated in mice, but the exact cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for this beneficial effect are unknown. We hypothesized that MJ can regulate select microglial functions, and used two different in vitro models of microglia  to test this hypothesis. MJ inhibited the production of damaging reactive oxygen  species by differentiated human HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells without reducing their viability. MJ also selectively upregulated phagocytic activity of  murine BV-2 microglia, but had no effect on nitric oxide secretion by these cells. Since microglial phagocytosis can be beneficial for clearance of amyloid ß aggregates in AD, the observed upregulation of phagocytic activity by MJ, combined with its inhibitory effect on reactive oxygen species production, supports continued studies of MJ as a candidate drug for managing adverse neuroinflammation in AD.

JIP1 plays significant and broad  roles in neurons, mainly as a regulator of kinesin1-dependent transport, and is associated with human pathologies such as cancer and Alzheimer disease. JIP1 is specifically recruited by the kinesin-light chain 1 (KLC1) of kinesin1, but the details of this interaction are not yet fully elucidated. Here, using calorimetry, we extensively biochemically characterized the interaction between KLC1 and JIP1. Using various truncated fragments of the tetratricopeptide repeat  (TPR) domain of KLC1, we narrowed down its JIP1-binding region and identified seven KLC1 residues critical for JIP1 binding. These isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC)-based binding data enabled us to footprint the JIP1-binding site on KLC1-TPR. This footprint was used to uncover the structural basis for the marginal inhibition of JIP1 binding by the autoinhibitory LFP-acidic motif of KLC1, as well as for the competition between JIP1 and another cargo protein of kinesin1, the W-acidic motif-containing alcadein-a. Also, we examined the role of each of these critical residues of KLC1 for JIP1 binding in light of the previously reported crystal structure of the KLC1-TPR:JIP1 complex. Finally, sequence search in eukaryotic genomes identified several proteins, among which is SH2D6, that exhibit a motif similar to the KLC1-binding motif of JIP1.

Different stages of diabetes-associated cognitive dysfunction  exist, each with different cognitive features, affected age groups and prognoses  and probably with different underlying mechanisms.

More severe stages, particularly mild cognitive impairment and dementia, with progressive deficits, occur primarily in older individuals (>65 years of age). Patients in the latter group are the most relevant for patient management and are the focus of this Review.

Methods: We used data from 2682 men in the population-based Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study who participated in extensive baseline health examinations and interviews between 1984 and 1989, when they were between 42 and  61 years of age. Childhood events were documented in these structured interviews.

Data on incident cases of dementia, including AD,  were obtained through 2014 via national health register linkages. Risk of developing dementia was estimated using Cox regression adjusting for age, education, income and prior/existing diseases at baseline. Results: Childhood stress was associated with increased risk of dementia (HR = 1.86, 95% CI: 1.12-3.10). Associations remained statistically significant after adjustment for age, education, income and other covariates (HR = 1.93, 95% CI: 1.14-3.25).

      "[CLS] Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder to date, with no cure or preventive therapy. Histopathological hallmarks of AD include deposition of ß-amyloid plaques and formation of neurofibrillary tangles in brain. Despite extensive research, only five approved drugs are available for the management of AD. Hence, there is a need to look for alternative therapies and new drugs. Use of natural products in medicine has gained popularity in recent years and several natural compounds with neuroprotective effects have been studied in detail. Some of them target the disease pathways and improve cognition by directly affecting amyloidogenesis, programmed cell death and increase neuronal cell survival. Currently, phytochemicals like polyphenols, alkaloids, terpenes, flavonoids, tannins, saponins and vitamins from plants have received a  special attention from the scientific community against the pathological processes in conditions like cancer, cardiovascular diseases and neurodegenerative diseases. Many efforts have been made to unravel the molecular  mechanisms and the specific interactions of phytochemicals, which [MASK] disease pathways in the AD. Further studies on these natural products and their mechanism of action, target specific effect in disease pathology parallel with the use of novel pharmaceutical drug design and delivery techniques, enable us to offer an addition to conventional medicine in treatment of AD. This review presents detailed information on natural products like polyphenols, alkaloids and terpenes with their potential effects in Alzheimers disease. [SEP]\t\ttargets\n",

      "[CLS] Alzheimers disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease pathologically characterized by extracellular amyloid-ß (Aß) deposits and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) in many brain regions. NFT are primarily composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein (p-Tau). Aß and p-Tau are two major pathogenic molecules with tau acting downstream to Aß to induce neuronal degeneration. In this study, we investigated whether Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761 reduces cerebral p-Tau level and prevents AD pathogenesis. Human P301S tau mutant-transgenic mice were fed with EGb 761, added to the regular diet for 2 or  5 [MASK]. We observed that treatment with EGb 761 for 5 [MASK] significantly improved the cognitive function of mice, attenuated the loss of synaptophysin and recovered the phosphorylation of CREB in the mouse brain. Treatment with EGb 761  for 5 but not 2 [MASK] also decreased p-Tau protein amount and shifted microglial pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory activation in the brain. As potential therapeutic mechanisms, we demonstrated that treatment with EGb 761, especially the components of ginkgolide A, bilobalide, and flavonoids, but not with purified ginkgolide B or C, increased autophagic activity and degradation of p-Tau in lysosomes of neurons. Inhibiting ATG5 function or treating cells with Bafilomycin B1 abolished EGb 761-enhanced degradation of p-Tau in cultured neurons. Additionally, we observed that 5- instead of 2-month-treatment with EGb 761 inhibited the activity of p38-MAPK and GSK-3ß. Therefore, long-term treatment with Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761, a clinically available and well-tolerated herbal medication, ameliorates AD pathology through mechanisms against multiple AD pathogenic processes.

      "[CLS] The identification of healthy individuals harboring amyloid pathology represents  one important challenge for secondary prevention clinical trials in Alzheimers disease (AD). Consequently, noninvasive and cost-efficient techniques to detect preclinical AD constitute an unmet need of critical importance. In this manuscript, we apply machine learning to structural MRI (T1 and DTI) of 96 cognitively [MASK] subjects to identify amyloid-positive ones. Models were trained on public ADNI data and validated on an independent local cohort. Used for subject classification in a simulated clinical trial setting, the proposed method is able to save 60% of unnecessary CSF/PET tests and to reduce 47% of the  cost of recruitment. This recruitment strategy capitalizes on available MR scans  to reduce the overall amount of invasive PET/CSF tests in prevention trials, demonstrating a potential value as a tool for preclinical AD screening. This protocol could foster the development of secondary prevention strategies for AD. [SEP]\t\tnormal\n",

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Considering the increasing evidence that disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimers disease (AD) must be administered early in the disease course, the development of diagnostic tools capable of accurately identifying AD at early disease stages has become a crucial target. In this view, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has become an effective tool to discriminate between different  forms of neurodegenerative dementia. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a TMS multi-paradigm [MASK] can be used to correctly identify mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD (AD MCI). METHODS: A sample of 69 subjects with MCI were included and classified as AD MCI  or MCI unlikely due to AD (non-AD MCI) based on 1) extensive neurological and neuropsychological evaluation, 2) MRI imaging, and 3) cerebrospinal fluid analysis or/and amyloid PET imaging. A paired-pulse TMS multi-paradigm [MASK] assessing short interval intracortical inhibition-facilitation (SICI-ICF), dependent on GABAergic and glutamatergic intracortical circuits, respectively, and short latency afferent inhibition (SAI), dependent on cholinergic circuits, was performed. RESULTS: We observed a significant impairment of SAI and unimpaired SICI and ICF  in AD MCI as compared to non-AD MCI. According to ROC curve analysis, the SICI-ICF / SAI index differentiated AD MCI from non-AD MCI with a specificity of  87.9% and a sensitivity of 94.4%. CONCLUSIONS: The assessment of intracortical connectivity with TMS could aid in the characterization of MCI subtypes, correctly identifying AD pathophysiology. TMS can be proposed as an adjunctive, non-invasive, inexpensive, and time-saving  screening tool in MCI differential diagnosis. [SEP]\t\tapproach\n",

      "[CLS] Alzheimers disease (AD), an age-related neurodegenerative condition, is the most common cause of dementia among the elder people, but currently there is no treatment. A number of putative pathogenic events, particularly amyloid [MASK] peptide (A[MASK]) accumulation, are believed to be early triggers that initiate AD. However, thus far targeting A[MASK] generation/aggregation as the mainstay strategy of drug development has not led to effective AD-modifying therapeutics. Oxidative damage  is a conspicuous feature of AD, but this remains poorly defined phenomenon and mechanistically ill understood. The TRPM2 channel has emerged as a potentially ubiquitous molecular mechanism mediating oxidative damage and thus plays a vital  role in the pathogenesis and progression of diverse neurodegenerative diseases. This article will review the emerging evidence from recent studies and propose a  novel hypothesis that multiple TRPM2-mediated cellular and molecular mechanisms cascade A[MASK] and/or oxidative damage to AD pathologies. The hypothesis based on these new findings discusses the prospect of considering the TRPM2 channel as a novel therapeutic target for intervening AD and age-related dementia. [SEP]\t\tß\n",

      "[CLS] INTRODUCTION: Alzheimers disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease [MASK] by protein aggregates of amyloid ß (Aß) and tau. These proteins have normal physiological functions, but in AD, they undergo a conformational change and aggregate as toxic oligomeric and fibrillar species with a high ß-sheet content. AREAS COVERED: Active and passive immunotherapeutic approaches are among the most attractive methods for targeting misfolded Aß and tau. Promising preclinical testing of various immunotherapeutic approaches has yet to translate to cognitive benefits in human clinical trials. Knowledge gained from these past failures has  led to the development of second-generation Aß-active immunotherapies, anti-Aß monoclonal antibodies targeting a wide array of Aß conformations, and to a number of immunotherapies targeting pathological tau. This review covers the more recent advances in vaccine development for AD from 2016 to present. EXPERT COMMENTARY: Due to the complex pathophysiology of AD, greatest clinical efficacy will most likely be achieved by concurrently targeting the most toxic forms of both Aß and tau.

      "[CLS] Activity-dependent plasticity of synaptic structure and function plays an essential role in neuronal development and in cognitive functions including learning and memory. The formation, maintenance and modulation of dendritic spines are mainly controlled by the dynamics of actin filaments (F-actin) through interaction with various actin-binding proteins ([MASK]) and postsynaptic signaling messengers. Induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) triggers a cascade of events involving Ca2+ signaling, intracellular pathways such as cAMP and cGMP, and regulation of [MASK] such as CaMKII, Cofilin, Aip1, Arp2/3, a-actinin, Profilin and Drebrin. We review here how these [MASK] modulate the rate of assembly, disassembly, stabilization and bundling of F-actin during LTP induction. We highlight the crucial role that CaMKII exerts in both functional and structural plasticity by directly coupling Ca2+ signaling with F-actin dynamics through the  ß subunit. Moreover, we show how cAMP and cGMP second messengers regulate postsynaptic structural potentiation. Brain disorders such as Alzheimers disease, schizophrenia or autism, are associated with alterations in the regulation of F-actin dynamics by these [MASK] and signaling messengers. Thus, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling actin cytoskeleton can provide cues for the treatment of these disorders. [SEP]\t\tABPs\n",

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Alzheimer disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder with distinct pathological features, with aging considered the greatest risk factor. We explored how aging contributes to increased AD risk, and determined concurrent and coordinate changes (including genetic and phenotypic modifications) [MASK]  exhibited in both normal aging and AD. METHODS: Using the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, we collected 1 healthy aging-related and 3 AD-related datasets of the hippocampal region. The normal aging dataset was divided into 3 age groups: young (20-40 years old), middle-aged (40-60 years old), and elderly (>60 years old). These datasets were used to analyze the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The Gene Ontology (GO) terms,  pathways, and function network analysis of these DEGs were analyzed. RESULTS: One thousand two hundred ninety-one DEGs were found to be shared in the  natural aging groups and AD patients. Among the shared DEGs, ATP6V1E1, GNG3, NDUFV2, GOT1, USP14, and NAV2 have been previously found in both normal aging individuals and AD patients. Furthermore, using Java Enrichment of Pathways Extended to Topology (JEPETTO) analysis based on Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and  Genomes (KEGG) database, we determined that changes in aging-related KEGG annotations may contribute to the aging-dependence of AD risk. Interestingly, NRXN3, the second most [MASK] deregulated gene identified in the present study, is known to carry a mutation in AD patients. According to functional network analysis, NRXN3 plays a critical role in synaptic functions involved in the cognitive decline associated with normal aging and AD. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the low expression of aging-related NRXN3 may increase AD risk, though the potential mechanism requires further clarification. [SEP]\t\tcommonly\n",

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Multimorbidity in dementia is associated with an increased risk of complications and a higher need for care. Having knowledge of cardiovascular and  metabolic comorbidities is crucial when making decisions about diagnostic procedures and therapies. We compared the prevalence of comorbidities in hospitalized patients with Alzheimers disease (AD), vascular dementia, and psychiatric diseases other than dementia. Additionally, we compared clinically relevant health-care indicators (length of hospital stay, rate of re-hospitalization) between these groups. METHODS: We used information from a [MASK]base of treatment-relevant indicators from psychiatric and psychosomatic hospitals throughout Germany. This [MASK]base contains routinely recorded [MASK] collected from 85 German hospitals from 2011 to  2015. In total, 14?411 AD cases, 7156 vascular dementia cases, and 34?534 cases involving non-demented psychiatric patients (used as controls) were included. To  analyze comorbidities and health-care indicators, ?2 tests and t-tests were used. RESULTS: Diabetes mellitus, lipoprotein disorders, coronary artery diseases, cardiac arrhythmia and insufficiency, and atherosclerosis were significantly more prevalent in patients with vascular dementia than in those with AD and psychiatric controls. Hypertension and coronary artery diseases were less frequently associated with AD than with non-demented psychiatric controls (P <?0.001). Additionally, dementia patients with cardiovascular or metabolic diseases exhibited longer hospital stays (+?1.4?days, P <?0.001) and were more often re-hospitalized within 3?weeks (P <?0.001) and 1?year (P <?0.001) compared  to dementia patients without these comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: Awareness of somatic comorbidities in patients with dementia is crucial to avoid complications during inpatient treatment. The occurrence of comorbid disorders was associated with longer and more frequent hospital stays, which potentially lead to higher health-care costs. Further studies should evaluate the causative association between somatic comorbidities and inpatient costs in dementia patients. [SEP]\t\tdata\n",

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Depression is a risk factor for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and for the conversion from MCI to Alzheimers disease (AD). This study investigated  regional cerebral glucose metabolism (rCMglc) in older adults with depression and MCI, either with or without amyloidopathy. METHODS: We recruited 31 older adults diagnosed with depression and MCI, and 21 older adults with normal cognition (NC). All participants completed demographic questionnaires and were examined with a standardized neuropsychological battery,  F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET), and F-18 florbetaben  PET. We classified subjects with depression and MCI into amyloid-ß-positive (CDAP; n?=?16) and amyloid-ß-negative (CDAN; n?=?15) groups. Pairwise rCMglc analyses were conducted between all three groups (CDAP vs. NC, CDAN vs. NC, and CDAP vs. CDAN). RESULTS: In comparison with the NC group, the CDAP group showed reduced rCMglc predominantly in temporoparietal regions, whereas the CDAN group showed lower rCMglc in regions of the frontal lobe, in addition to the temporoparietal regions. The CDAN group also showed lower rCMglc in right anterior cingulate and  left inferior orbitofrontal regions, in a comparison between the CDAP and CDAN groups. LIMITATIONS: The generalizability of the findings is limited because this study has a [MASK] small number of participants. In addition, this study used cross-sectional design rather than longitudinal design. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings may provide a reference to assess the risk of future cognitive deterioration.

Therefore, our present study is  to investigate the potential therapeutic neuroprotective effects of nootkatone (NKT) on an AD mouse model induced by intracerebroventricular injection of LPS. We found that NKT (10?mg/kg) group showed good performance in behavior experiments including Y-[MASK] test and Morris water [MASK] test. The results of histopathological examination and immunohistochemical analysis showed that LPS induced degeneration of neurons and activation of microglia particularly in hippocampus and NKT (10?mg/kg) reversed these changes.

      "[CLS] With aging, there are progressive functional declines in multiple organ systems.  One of the major physiological problems observed in aged people is skeletal muscle loss. This age-related muscle loss causes muscle weakness and disability,  which in turn might reduce the quality of life in older adults and lead to the progression of several diseases, particularly Alzheimers disease (AD). Some researchers have hypothesized that loss of muscle mass and strength is linked to  the risk of developing AD. In addition, unintended weight loss often occurs in AD patients and might reflect dementia severity. However, the causal [MASK] between muscle atrophy and cognitive deficits in AD is unclear. We found that double transgenic amyloid precursor protein and presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) mice that  co-express APP and PS1 at older ages exhibited lower body weight and lean tissue  mass than sex- and age-matched wild-type (WT) mice. In addition, muscle atrophy and the extent of memory decline were strongly correlated in APP/PS1 mice. Myostatin levels in the gastrocnemius (GAS) muscle of 12-month-old APP/PS1 mice were elevated. We determined that the cellular and molecular mechanism of muscle  atrophy was through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Furthermore, myostatin knockdown in the GAS muscles increased grip strength and muscle mass, leading to  memory improvement in myostatin short-hairpin RNA-treated APP/PS1 mice. We conclude that high-level myostatin expression might mediate or trigger muscle atrophy and cognitive deficits. [SEP]\t\trelationship\n",

In addition to baseline and 6-month quantitative survey data on context of care, primary objective stressors, resources, self-efficacy/competence, and distress collected from caregivers, 6-month RAM review checklists contained open-ended, qualitative information on perceived acceptability of the technology. Results: The RAM system did not exert statistically significant effects on caregiving outcomes over a 6-month period. However, qualitative analyses identified several potential moderators of RAM technology effectiveness that were subsequently tested in post-hoc repeated measures analyses of variance. Caregivers who utilized RAM technology and cared for relatives with: (a) less severe cognitive impairment; and (b) difficulty navigating around the home were more likely to indicate statistically significant increases in competence and self-efficacy, respectively. Discussion and Implications: We found that the early months spent calibrating and modifying RAM are potentially challenging for families, which may prevent this technology from improving caregiving outcomes during initial months of use.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Inflammation is a protective response of the body system that protects the body from the various kinds of external and internal insults; however, it has been found that most chronic illnesses are caused by dysregulated and excessive inflammation. Inflammation plays a major role in developing neurological diseases. In the brain cytokines, TNF-a and TNF-ß are known to mediate inflammation in many diseases. Functions of these cytokines are regulated by the activation of transcription factor NF-?b. Recent evidence suggest that curcumin has an immense therapeutic potential because of its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties. It has been tested for treating various chronic illnesses associated with the brain. OBJECTIVE: The study aims to elucidate the role of curcumin in alleviating the inflammatory reactions initiated by TNF-a and NF-?b signaling. METHODS: This study is a survey of literature from [MASK] like PubMed central, science direct, medline and available scientific databases to determine how inflammation plays an important role in the development of neurodegenerative diseases and the role of curcumin as an anti-inflammatory agent. Looking into the importance of curcumin in alleviating inflammatory responses, several patents are filed and accepted which are referenced in this article. RESULTS: Neuro-inflammation mediated by TNF-a plays a major role in the development of pathologies like Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis etc. Curcumin appears to subside or reduce the inflammatory responses. Thus, it appears to have therapeutic potential for treating various neuroinflammatory diseases. CONCLUSION: Cytokines get upregulated during neurodegenerative diseases as a result of which inflammatory responses are initiated in the brain. Curcumin is reported to have anti-inflammatory properties and thereby its supplementation may help in reducing the inflammation. Future research on this area will further explain the mode of action of curcumin in alleviating neuroinflammation. [SEP]\t\tsources\n",

Even within [MASK] same disease, [MASK]re is considerable phenotypic heterogeneity with varying symptoms and disease trajectories. Dementia diagnosis is thus very complex, time-consuming, and expensive and can only be made definitively post-mortem with histopathological confirmation. These inherent difficulties combined with [MASK] overlap of some symptoms and even neuropathological features, present a challenging problem for research in [MASK] field. This has likely hampered progress in epidemiological studies of risk factors and preventative interventions, as well as genetic and biomarker research. Resource limitations in large epidemiologically studies mean that limited diagnostic criteria are often used, which can result in phenotypically heterogeneous disease states being grouped toge[MASK]r, potentially resulting in misclassification bias. When biomarkers are identified for etiologically heterogeneous diseases, [MASK]y will have low specificity for any utility in clinical practice, even if [MASK]ir sensitivity is high. We highlight several challenges in in [MASK] field which must be addressed for [MASK] success of future genetic and biomarker studies, and may be key to [MASK] development of [MASK] most effective treatments. As a step toward achieving this goal, defining [MASK] dementia as a biological construct based on [MASK] presence of specific pathological features, ra[MASK]r than clinical symptoms, will enable more precise predictive models.

      "[CLS] The multitude of molecular pathways underlying memory impairment in neurological  disorders and aging-related disorders has been a major hurdle against therapeutic targeting. Over the years, neuronal growth promoting factors, intracellular kinases, and specific transcription factors, particularly cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB), have emerged as crucial players of memory storage, and their disruption accompanies many cognitive disabilities. However, a molecular link that can influence these major players and can be a [MASK] recovery target has been elusive. Recent reports suggest that extracellular cues  at the synapses might evoke an intracellular signaling cascade and regulate memory function. Herein, we report novel function of an extracellular serine protease, kallikrein 8 (KLK8/Neuropsin) in regulating the expression of microtubule associated dendrite growth marker microtubule-associated protein (MAP2)c, dendrite architecture and protein kinase A (PKA)-CREB signaling. Both knockdown of KLK8 via siRNA transfection in mouse primary hippocampal neurons and via intra-hippocampal administration of KLK8 antisense oligonucleotides in vivo reduced expression of MAP2c, dendrite length, dendrite branching and spine density. The KLK8 mediated MAP2c deficiency in turn inactivated PKA and downstream transcription factor phosphorylated CREB (pCREB), leading to downregulation of memory-linked genes and consequent impaired memory consolidation. These findings revealed a protease associated novel pathway of memory impairment in which KLK8 may act as a \"regulator of regulators\", suggesting its exploration as an important therapeutic target of memory disorders.

      "[CLS] Alzheimers disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, lacks preclinical diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic drugs. Thus, earlier intervention in AD is a top priority. Studies have shown that the gut microbiota  influences central nervous system disorders and that [MASK]s can improve the cognition of hosts with AD, but these effects are not well understood. Preliminary research has shown that oligosaccharides from Morinda officinalis (OMO) are a useful [MASK] and cause substantial memory improvements in animal  models of AD; however, the mechanism is still unclear. Therefore, this study was  conducted to investigate whether OMO are clinically effective in alleviating AD by improving gut microbiota. OMO were administered to APP/PS1 transgenic mice, and potential clinical biomarkers of AD were identified with metabolomics and bioinformatics. Behavioral experiments demonstrated that OMO significantly ameliorated the memory of the AD animal model. Histological changes indicated that OMO ameliorated brain tissue swelling and neuronal apoptosis and downregulated the expression of the intracellular AD marker Aß1-42. 16S rRNA sequencing analyses indicated that OMO maintained the diversity and stability of  the microbial community. The data also indicated that OMO are an efficacious [MASK] in an animal model of AD, regulating the composition and metabolism of  the gut microbiota. A serum metabolomics assay was performed using UHPLC-LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometry to delineate the metabolic changes and potential early biomarkers in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Multivariate statistical analysis showed that 14 metabolites were significantly upregulated, and 8 metabolites were downregulated in the model animals compared to the normal controls. Thus, key metabolites represent early indicators of the development of AD. Overall, we report a drug and signaling pathway with therapeutic potential, including proteins associated with cognitive deficits in normal mice or gene mutations that cause AD.

      "[CLS] A growing body of literature has established a link between the cerebral ischaemic injury and pathological state of Alzheimers disease (AD), and this [MASK] indicated that the preventive agent for ischaemia might improve the pathology of AD. Our previous studies have demonstrated that Neohesperidin (NH) exhibited neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemia via the down-regulation of Bcl-2, Akt/PI3K and Nrf2 pathways. In the present study, we first confirmed the protective effects of NH on Aß25-35-induced neurotoxicity on  primary cultured hippocampal neurons. We further demonstrated NH attenuated Aß25-35-induced apoptosis by preventing neurotoxicity associated with lethal UPR  and ER stress via blocking S-nitrosylation of protein-disulphide isomerase (PDI). These results suggested that S-nitrosylation of PDI and ER dysfunction might be the synergistic and synchronous pathological process between cerebral ischaemia and AD. [SEP]\t\tcorrelation\n",

      "[CLS] Increasing evidence shows that ß-amyloid (Aß) peptides, which are associated with Alzheimer disease (AD), are heavily glycated in patients, suggesting a role of this irreversible nonenzymatic post-translational modification in pathology.

Here, we used the natural metabolic by-product methylglyoxal as a glycating agent and exploited various spectroscopic methods and atomic force microscopy to study how glycation affects  the structures of the Aß40 and Aß42 peptides, the aggregation pathway, and the morphologies of the resulting aggregates. We found that glycation significantly slows down but does not [MASK] ß-conversion to mature fibers.

      "[CLS] Alzheimers disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with multiple pathological consequences such as oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, cholinergic deficit, amyloid plaques, and tangles formation. Hence, development of drugs with multiple targets will be effective in the treatment of  AD. The present study aims at evaluation of the neuroprotective effect of Gelidiella acerosa against amyloid beta 25-35 (Aß 25-35) induced toxicity in PC12 cells. The antioxidative effect was evaluated by monitoring levels of antioxidant enzymes. Protection against ROS-induced [MASK] was assessed by the measurement of lipid peroxidation, protein carbonyl content (PCC), 2,7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) fluorescence, and nitric oxide (NO) production. The cholinesterase (ChE) inhibitory activity was also evaluated. The antiapoptotic activity was verified by caspase-3 activity. The results of antioxidant assays suggest that G. acerosa significantly (P < .05) restores the levels of antioxidant enzymes. Moreover, the seaweed extract was found to prevent the formation of intracellular ROS induced by Aß 25-35 and thereby protects PC12 cells from macromolecular [MASK]. The study demonstrated that G. acerosa inhibits ChE activity significantly (P < .05) in PC12 cells. The significant decrease (P < .05) in the level of caspase-3 activity indicates that the seaweed has anti-apoptotic activity.

VPA also significantly inhibited [MASK] generation of ROS induced by Aß25-35 in PC12 cells in a dose-dependent manner.

      "[CLS] Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common type of neurological disorder that results from brain cell death; however, not all brain regions are simultaneously  affected to the same extent. Despite single biomarkers for AD having been determined on a genome-wide scale, the differential co-expression in gene pairs between regions and interactions with other types of cellular molecules, particularly non-coding (nc)RNAs, are often overlooked in studies investigating the underlying mechanisms associated with AD. In the present study, based on 1,548 samples obtained from a cohort of 90 patients with AD spanning 19 brain regions, a gene-pair based method was established for the classification of 19 brain regions into seven different groups, including marked disparate groupings of six single regions and a cluster of another 13 regions as revealed by principal component analysis (PCA). To further investigate the different underlying mechanisms associated with each group, five highly interconnected functional modules of the protein-protein interaction network were demonstrated to characterize the seven region groups containing six single groups and 13 clustered regions based on 4,731 gene-pairs. Genes in two of the functional modules exhibited a strong association with pathways associated with the nervous  system, including cholinergic synapses, circadian entrainment and dopaminergic synapses. Notably, following integration of these two modules with a ncRNA-mediated network, one module demonstrated a strong association with micro [MASK] which were revealed to interact with numerous long non-coding (lnc)RNAs associated with AD, such as metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript  1 and taurine upregulated 1. This suggested that mRNAs and lncRNAs may represent  competing endogenous RNAs for binding with miRNAs. Thus, these results indicated  that the ncRNA-mediated gene regulatory module detected by the established gene pair-based method may further the understanding of underlying mechanisms associated with AD as well as aid the development of novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of patients with AD.

      "[CLS] Introduction: Treatments for Alzheimers disease (AD) are needed due to the growing number of individuals with preclinical, prodromal, and dementia forms of  AD. Drug development for AD therapies can be examined by inspecting the drug development pipeline as represented on clinicaltrials.gov. Methods: Clinicaltrials.gov was assessed as of January 30, 2018 to determine AD therapies represented in phase I, phase [MASK], and phase [MASK]I. Results: There are 112 agents in the current AD treatment pipeline. There are 26  agents in 35 trials in phase [MASK]I, 63 agents in 75 trials in phase [MASK], and 23 agents in 25 trials in phase I. A review of the mechanisms of actions of the agents in the pipeline shows that 63% are disease-modifying therapies, 22% are symptomatic cognitive enhancers, and 12% are symptomatic agents addressing neuropsychiatric and behavioral changes. Trials in phase [MASK]I are larger and longer than phase [MASK] or phase I trials, particularly those involving disease-modifying agents. Comparison with the 2017 pipeline shows that there are  four new agents in phase [MASK]I, 14 in phase [MASK], and eight in phase I. Inspection of the use of biomarkers as revealed on clinicaltrials.gov shows that amyloid biomarkers are used as entry criterion in 14 phase [MASK]I disease-modifying agent trials and 17 disease-modifying agent trials in phase [MASK]. Twenty-one trials of disease-modifying agents in phase [MASK] did not require biomarker confirmation for AD at trial entry. Discussion: The AD drug development pipeline is slightly larger in 2018 than in 2017. Trials increasingly include preclinical and prodromal populations. There is an increase in nonamyloid mechanisms of action for drugs in earlier phases of drug development. Biomarkers are increasingly used in AD drug development but are not used uniformly for AD diagnosis confirmation. [SEP]\t\tII\n",

Crenezumab is an antiamyloid monoclonal antibody that binds monomeric and aggregated forms of amyloid ß, with highest affinity for oligomers; it is in development for early stages of sporadic AD and for ADAD. Methods: This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 study of the efficacy of crenezumab versus placebo in asymptomatic PSEN1  E280A mutation carriers from family kindreds with ADAD in Colombia. Participants  were randomized to receive either crenezumab or placebo for 260 weeks. The study  was designed to enroll a planned total of 300 participants, including 200 preclinical mutation carriers (approximately 100 treatment, 100 placebo) and an additional control group of mutation noncarriers from the same family kindreds included to mask mutation carrier status (100 placebo only). The primary outcome  is change in the Alzheimers Prevention Initiative ADAD Composite Cognitive Test  Score from baseline to week 260. Secondary outcomes include time to progression to mild cognitive impairment due to AD or dementia due to AD; changes in dementia severity, memory, and overall neurocognitive functioning; and changes in amyloid-positron emission tomography, fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging volumes, and cerebrospinal fluid levels of ß amyloid, tau, and p-tau. Safety and tolerability are assessed. Results: Two hundred fifty-two participants were enrolled between December 2013 and February 2017. Discussion: We describe the first large-scale, potentially label-enabling clinical trial of a preclinical treatment for ADAD. Results from this trial will  inform on the efficacy of crenezumab for delaying onset of, slowing [MASK] in, or preventing cognitive impairment in individuals with preclinical ADAD and will  foster an improved understanding of AD biomarkers and their relationship to clinical outcomes.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) as investigational intervention for symptomatic relief from Alzheimer disease (AD) has generated big expectations. Our aim is to discuss the ethical justification of this research agenda by examining the underlying research rationale as well as potential methodological pitfalls. The shortcomings we address are of high ethical importance because only scientifically valid research has the potential to be ethical. METHOD: We performed a systematic search on MEDLINE and EMBASE. We included 166 publications about DBS for AD into the analysis of research rationale, risks and  ethical aspects. Fifty-eight patients were reported in peer-reviewed j[MASK]nals with very mixed results. A grey literature search revealed hints for 75 yet to be published, potentially enrolled patients. RESULTS: The results of [MASK] systematic review indicate methodological shortcomings in the literature that are both scientific and ethical in nature. According to [MASK] analysis, research with human subjects was performed before decisive preclinical research was published examining the specific research question at stake. We also raise the concern that conclusions on the potential safety and efficacy have been reported in the literature that seem premature given the design of the feasibility studies from which they were drawn. In addition, some publications report that DBS for AD was performed without written  informed consent from some patients, but from surrogates only. Furthermore, registered ongoing trials plan to enroll severely demented patients. We provide reasons that this would violate Art. 28 of the Declaration of Helsinki, because DBS for AD involves more than minimal risks and burdens, and because its efficacy and safety are not yet empirically established to be likely. CONCLUSION: Based on [MASK] empirical analysis, we argue that clinical research on interventions of risk class III (Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency) should not be exploratory but grounded on sound, preclinically  tested, and disease-specific a posteriori hypotheses. This also applies to DBS for dementia as long as therapeutic benefits are uncertain, and especially when research subjects with cognitive deficits are involved, who may foreseeably progress to full incapacity to provide informed consent during the required follow-up period.

      "[CLS] Deposition of Tau aggregates in patients brains is a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases collectively called [MASK]. One of the most studied [MASK] is Alzheimer disease (AD) in which Tau protein aggregates into filaments and coalesces into neurofibrillary tangles. The distribution of Tau filaments is a reliable indicator of the clinical stages of AD (Braak stages), but intermediate oligomeric assemblies of Tau are considered to be more  directly toxic to neurons than late stage filaments. Studying the elusive role of Tau oligomers has been difficult because of their dynamic nature and paucity of methods to purify them in vitro. In this chapter, we describe methods to purify Tau oligomers to near homogeneity and to characterize them by hydrophobic interaction chromatography and biophysical methods such as fluorescence spectrophotometry, dynamic light scattering, atomic force microscopy, and others. Functional characterization includes the assessment of synapses and toxicity assays which show that oligomers can damage synapses locally but show little toxicity to neurons globally.

      "[CLS] Protein and peptide oligomers are thought to play important roles in the pathogenesis of a number of neurodegenerative diseases. For this reason, considerable effort has been devoted to understanding the oligomerization process and to determining structure-activity relationships among the many types of oligomers that have been described. We discuss here a method for producing pure populations of amyloid ß-protein (Aß) of specific sizes using the most pathologic form of the peptide, Aß42. This work was necessitated because Aß oligomerization  produces oligomers of many different sizes that are non-covalently associated, which means ?that dissociation or further assembly may occur. These characteristics preclude rigorous structure-activity determinations. In studies of Aß40, we have used the method of photo-induced cross-linking of unmodified proteins (PICUP) to produce zero-length carbon-carbon bonds among the monomers comprising each oligomer, thus stabilizing the oligomers. We then isolated pure populations of oligomers [MASK] fractionating the oligomers [MASK] size using SDS-PAGE and then extracting each population from the stained gel bands. Although this procedure worked well with the shorter Aß40 peptide, we found that a significant  percentage of Aß42 oligomers had not been stabilized. Here, we discuss a new method capable of yielding stable Aß42 oligomers of sizes from dimer through dodecamer. [SEP]\t\tby\n",

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Semantic verbal fluency (SVF) tests are routinely used in screening for mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In this task, participants name as many items as possible [MASK] a semantic category under a time constraint. Clinicians measure task performance manually by summing the number [MASK] correct words and errors. More fine-grained variables add valuable information to clinical assessment, but are time-consuming. Therefore, the aim [MASK] this study is to investigate whether automatic analysis [MASK] the SVF could provide these as accurate as manual and thus, support qualitative screening [MASK] neurocognitive impairment. METHODS: SVF data were collected from 95 older people with MCI (n = 47), Alzheimers or related dementias (ADRD; n = 24), and healthy controls (HC; n = 24). All data were annotated manually and automatically with clusters and switches. The obtained metrics were validated using a classifier to distinguish HC, MCI, and ADRD. RESULTS: Automatically extracted clusters and switches were highly correlated (r  = 0.9) with manually established values, and performed as well on the classification task separating HC from persons with ADRD (area under curve [AUC]  = 0.939) and MCI (AUC = 0.758).

      "[CLS] It is now established that cholesterol oxidation products (oxysterols) are involved in several events underlying Alzheimers disease (AD) pathogenesis. Of note, certain oxysterols cause neuron dysfunction and degeneration but, recently, some of them have been shown also to have neuroprotective effects. The present study, which aimed to understand the potential effects of 24-hydroxycholesterol (24-OH) against the intraneuronal accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, stressed these latter effects. A beneficial effect of 24-OH was [MASK] in SK-N-BE neuroblastoma cells, and is due to its ability to modulate the deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), which contributes to preventing the neurotoxic accumulation of the hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Unlike 24-OH, 7-ketocholesterol (7-K) did not modulate the SIRT1-dependent neuroprotective pathway. To confirm the neuroprotective role of 24-OH, in vivo experiments were run on mice that express human tau without spontaneously developing tau pathology (hTau mice), by means of the intracerebroventricular injection of 24-OH. 24-OH, unlike 7-K, was found to completely prevent the hyperphosphorylation of tau induced by amyloid ß monomers. These data highlight the importance of preventing  the loss of 24-OH in the brain, and of maintaining high levels of the enzyme SIRT1, in order to counteract neurodegeneration.

      "[CLS] Magnesium is well known for its diverse actions within the human body. From a neurological standpoint, magnesium plays an essential [MASK] in nerve transmission  and neuromuscular conduction. It also functions in a protective [MASK] against excessive excitation that can lead to neuronal cell death (excitotoxicity), and has been implicated in multiple neurological disorders. Due to these important functions within the nervous system, magnesium is a mineral of intense interest for the potential prevention and treatment of neurological disorders. Current literature is reviewed for migraine, chronic pain, epilepsy, Alzheimer&rsquo;s, Parkinson&rsquo;s, and stroke, as well as the commonly comorbid conditions of anxiety and depression. Previous reviews and meta-analyses are used to set the scene for magnesium research across neurological conditions, while current research is reviewed in greater detail to update the literature and demonstrate the progress (or lack thereof) in the field. There is strong data to suggest a [MASK] for magnesium in migraine and depression, and emerging data to suggest a protective effect of magnesium for chronic pain, anxiety, and stroke. More research is needed on magnesium as an adjunct treatment in epilepsy, and to further clarify its [MASK] in Alzheimer&rsquo;s and Parkinson&rsquo;s. Overall, the mechanistic attributes of magnesium in neurological diseases connote the macromineral as a potential target for neurological disease prevention and treatment. [SEP]\t\trole\n",

      "[CLS] A miniaturized biosensing platform, based on monoclonal amyloid-beta antibodies (mAßab) that were immobilized on a disc-shaped platinum/iridium (Pt/Ir) microelectrode surface coupled with an impedimetric signal transducer, was developed for the label-free and sensitive detection of amyloid-beta peptide fragment 1-40 (Aß40); a reliable biomarker for early diagnosis of Alzheimers disease (AD). A Pt/Ir microelectrode was electropolymerized with poly (ortho-phenylenediamine), a conducting free amine-containing aromatic polymer; followed by crosslinking with glutaraldehyde for subsequent coupling of mAßab on  the microelectrode surface. This modification strategy efficiently improved the impedimetric detection performance of Aß40 in terms of charge transfer resistance (~400-fold difference) and normalized impedance magnitude percentage change (~40% increase) compared with a passive adsorption-based immobilization method. The sensitivity of the micro-immunosensing assay was found to be 1056 kO/(pg/mL)/cm2  and the limit of detection was found to be 4.81?pg/mL with a dynamic range of 1-104?pg/mL [MASK] The overall precision of the assay, as measured by relative standard deviation, ranged from 0.84 to 5.15%, demonstrating its reliability and accuracy; while in respect to assay durability and stability, the immobilized mAßab were able to maintain 80% of their binding activity to Aß40 after incubation for 48?h?at ambient temperature (25?°C). To validate the practical applicability, the assay was tested using brain tissue lysates prepared from AD-induced rats. Results indicate that the proposed impedimetric micro-immunosensing platform is highly versatile and adaptable for the quantitative detection of other disease-related biomarkers.

      "[CLS] Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) imaging based 3D topographic brain glucose metabolism patterns from normal controls (NC) and individuals with dementia of Alzheimers type ([MASK]) are used to train a novel multi-scale ensemble classification model. This ensemble model outputs a FDG-PET  [MASK] score (FPDS) between 0 and 1 denoting the probability of a subject to be clinically diagnosed with [MASK] based on their metabolism profile. A novel 7 group  image stratification scheme is devised that groups images not only based on their associated clinical diagnosis but also on past and future trajectories of the clinical diagnoses, yielding a more continuous representation of the different stages of [MASK] spectrum that mimics a real-world clinical setting. The potential for using FPDS as a [MASK] biomarker was validated on a large number of FDG-PET images (N=2984) obtained from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database taken across the proposed stratification, and a good classification AUC (area under the curve) of 0.78 was achieved in distinguishing  between images belonging to subjects on a [MASK] trajectory and those images taken from subjects not progressing to a [MASK] diagnosis.

Integrating studies of human postmortem brain tissue and Drosophila melanogaster models, we investigate TE activation in association with Tau pathology in Alzheimers disease (AD). Leveraging RNA sequencing from 636 human brains, we discover differential expression for several [MASK] in association with neurofibrillary tangle burden and highlight evidence for global  TE transcriptional activation among the long interspersed nuclear element 1 and endogenous retrovirus clades. In addition, we detect Tau-associated, active chromatin signatures at multiple HERV-Fc1 genomic loci. To determine whether Tau  is sufficient to induce TE activation, we profile [MASK] in Drosophila  expressing human wild-type or mutant Tau throughout the brain. We discover heterogeneous response profiles, including both age- and genotype-dependent activation of TE expression by Tau. Our results implicate TE activation and associated genomic instability in Tau-mediated AD mechanisms. [SEP]\t\tretrotransposons\n",

      "[CLS] Cross-sectional epidemiological studies have shown that [MASK] incidence of several  nervous system diseases is more frequent in epilepsy patients than in [MASK] general population. Some comorbidities [e.g. Alzheimers disease (AD) and Parkinsons disease] are also risk factors for [MASK] development of seizures; suggesting [MASK]y may share pathophysiological mechanisms with epilepsy. A literature-based approach was used to identify gene overlap between epilepsy and its comorbidities as a proxy for a shared genetic basis for disease, or genetic pleiotropy, as a first effort to identify shared mechanisms. While [MASK] results identified neurological disorders as [MASK] group of diseases with [MASK] highest gene overlap, this analysis was insufficient for identifying putative common mechanisms shared  across epilepsy and its comorbidities. This motivated [MASK] use of a dedicated literature mining and knowledge assembly approach in which a cause-and-effect model of epilepsy was captured with Biological Expression Language. After enriching [MASK] knowledge assembly with information surrounding epilepsy, its risk  factors, its comorbidities, and anti-epileptic drugs, a novel comparative mechanism enrichment approach was used to propose several downstream effectors (including [MASK] GABA receptor, GABAergic pathways, etc.) that could explain [MASK] [MASK]rapeutic effects carbamazepine in both [MASK] contexts of epilepsy and AD. We have made [MASK] Epilepsy Knowledge Assembly available at https://www.scai.fraunhofer.de/content/dam/scai/de/downloads/bioinformatik/epilep sy.bel and queryable through NeuroMMSig at http://neurommsig.scai.fraunhofer.de.

      "[CLS] OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between [MASK] sleep duration and risk  of dementia and death in a Japanese elderly population. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: The Hisayama Study, Japan. PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling Japanese individuals aged 60 and older without dementia. MEASUREMENTS: Self-reported [MASK] sleep duration was grouped into 5 categories (<5.0, 5.0-6.9, 7.0-7.9, 8.0-9.9, =10.0 hours). The association between [MASK] sleep duration and risk of dementia and death was determined using a Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: During follow-up, 294 participants developed dementia, and 282 died. Age- and sex-adjusted incidence rates of dementia and all-cause mortality were significantly greater in subjects with [MASK] sleep duration of less than 5.0 hours and 10.0 hours and more than in those with [MASK] sleep duration of 5.0 to 6.9 hours. These associations remained unchanged after adjustment for potential confounding factors (<5.0 hours: hazard ratio (HR)=2.64, 95% confidence interval  (CI)=1.38-5.05 for dementia; HR=2.29, 95% CI=1.15-4.56 for death; =10.0 hours: HR=2.23, 95% CI=1.42-3.49 for dementia; HR=1.67, 95% CI=1.07-2.60 for death). Similar U-shaped associations were observed for Alzheimers disease and vascular  dementia. With regard to the influence of hypnotic use on risk of dementia and death, subjects who used hypnotics and had any sleep duration had a risk of dementia that was 1.66 times as great and a risk of death that was 1.83 times as  great as those who did not use hypnotics and had a [MASK] sleep duration of 5.0 to 6.9 hours. CONCLUSION: Short and long [MASK] sleep duration and hypnotic use are risk factors for dementia and death in Japanese elderly adults. [SEP]\t\tdaily\n",

      "[CLS] Allosteric sites on proteins are targeted for designing more selective inhibitors of enzyme activity and to discover new functions. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), which is most widely known for the hydrolysis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, has a peripheral allosteric subsite responsible for amyloidosis in Alzheimers disease through interaction with amyloid ß-peptide. However, AChE plays other non-hydrolytic functions. Here, we identify and characterise using computational tools [MASK] new allosteric sites in AChE, which have allowed us to identify allosteric inhibitors by virtual screening guided by structure-based and fragment hotspot strategies. The identified compounds were also screened for in vitro inhibition of AChE and three were observed to be active. Further experimental (kinetic) and computational (molecular dynamics) studies have been performed to verify the allosteric activity. These new compounds may be valuable  pharmacological tools in the study of non-cholinergic functions of AChE. [SEP]\t\ttwo\n",

      "[CLS] Effective and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimers disease (AD), as well as its early stage (mild cognitive impairment, MCI), has attracted more and more attention recently. Researchers have constructed threshold brain function networks and extracted various features for the classification of brain diseases. However, in the construction of the brain function network, the selection of threshold is very important, and the unreasonable setting will seriously affect the final classification results. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a minimum spanning tree (MST) classification framework to identify Alzheimers disease (AD), MCI, and normal controls (NCs). [MASK] proposed method mainly uses the MST method, graph-based Substructure Pattern mining (gSpan), and  graph kernel Principal Component Analysis (graph kernel PCA). Specifically, MST is used to construct the brain functional connectivity network; gSpan, to extract features; and subnetwork selection and graph kernel PCA, to select features. Finally, the support vector machine is used to perform classification. We evaluate our method on MST brain functional networks of 21 AD, 25 MCI, and 22 NC  subjects. [MASK] experimental results show that our proposed method achieves classification accuracy of 98.3, 91.3, and 77.3%, for MCI vs. NC, AD vs. NC, and  AD vs. MCI, respectively. [MASK] results show our proposed method can achieve significantly improved classification performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods. [SEP]\t\tThe\n",

      "[CLS] Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and pathologically featured by ß-amyloid (Aß) plaque deposition and hyper-phosphorylated tau aggregation in the brain. Environmental factors are believed to contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of AD. In the present study, we investigated the impacts of acute hypoxia on Aß and tau pathologies, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial function, and autophagy in [MASK] AD mouse model. Male [MASK] transgenic (Tg) mice and their age-matched wild type (Wt) littermates were exposed to one single acute hypoxic episode (oxygen 7%) for 24 h. We found that acute hypoxia exposure increased the expressions of amyloid precursor protein (APP), anterior pharynx-defective 1 (APH1) and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), and promoted tau phosphorylation at T181 and T231 residues in both Tg and Wt mice. In addition, acute hypoxia also induced autophagy through the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, elicited abnormal mitochondrial function and neuroinflammation in both Tg and Wt mice. In summary,  all these findings suggest that acute hypoxia could induce the AD-like pathological damages in the brain of [MASK] mice and Wt mice to some extent. [SEP]\t\tAPPswe/PS1dE9\n",

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: [MASK] imaging is an established technique to detect cerebral amyloid-ß  (Aß) plaques in vivo. Some preclinical and postmortem data report an accumulation of redox-active iron near Aß plaques. Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) at high-field MRI enables iron deposits to be depicted with high spatial resolution. OBJECTIVE: Aim of this study was to examine whether iron and Aß plaque accumulation is related and thus, whether 7T MRI might be an additive diagnostic  tool to Aß [MASK] imaging. METHODS: Postmortem human Alzheimers disease (AD) and healthy control (HC) frontal gray matter (GM) was imaged with 7T MRI which resulted in T1 maps and QSM. Aß plaque load was determined by histopathology. In vivo, 10 Aß [MASK]-positive AD patients (74.1±6.0a) and 10 Aß [MASK]-negative HCs (67.1±4.4a) underwent 7T MR examination and QSM maps were analyzed. Severity of cognitive deficits was determined by MMSE. RESULTS: Postmortem, the susceptibility of Aß plaque-containing GM were higher than those of Aß plaque-free GM (0.011±0.002 versus - 0.008±0.003?ppm, p?<?0.001). In vivo, only the bilateral globus pallidus showed significantly higher susceptibility in AD patients compared to HCs (right: 0.277±0.018 versus - 0.009±0.009?ppm; left: 0.293±0.014 versus - 0.007±0.012?ppm, p?<?0.0001). The pallidal QSM values were negatively correlated with those of the MMSE (r?=?- 0.69, p?=?0.001). CONCLUSION: The postmortem study revealed significant susceptibility differences  between the Aß plaque-containing and Aß plaque-free GM, whereas in vivo only the  QSM values of the globus pallidus differed significantly between AD and HC group. The pallidal QSM values correlated with the severity of cognitive deficits. These findings encourage efforts to optimize the 7T-QSM methodology. [SEP]\t\tPET\n",

      "[CLS] The \"Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis\" has dominated the Alzheimers disease (AD) field in the last 25 years. It posits that the increase of amyloid-ß [MASK] is the key event in AD that triggers tau pathology followed by neuronal death and eventually, the disease. However, therapeutic approaches aimed at decreasing Aß levels have so far failed, and tau-based clinical trials have not yet produced positive findings. This begs the question of whether the hypothesis is correct. Here we have examined literature on the role of Aß and tau in synaptic dysfunction, memory loss, and seeding and spreading of AD, highlighting important parallelisms between the two proteins in all of these phenomena. We discuss novel findings showing binding of both Aß and tau oligomers to amyloid-ß protein precursor (AßPP), and the requirement for the presence of this protein for both Aß and tau to enter neurons and induce abnormal synaptic function and memory. Most importantly, we propose a novel view of AD pathogenesis in which extracellular oligomers of Aß and tau act in parallel and upstream of AßPP. Such  a view will call for a reconsideration of therapeutic approaches directed against Aß and tau, paving the way to an increased interest toward AßPP, both for understanding the pathogenesis of the disease and elaborating new therapeutic strategies.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Alzheimers disease (AD) is recognized as progressive multifaceted and multi-factorial neurodegenerative disorder which causes dementia among elderly people. Although, researchers in this field have put considerable efforts for the investigation of novel and appropriate therapeutic measures towards the cure of AD, unfortunately, no effective prevention therapy for this disease is available till date. In fact, various aspects involved in the onset and progression of AD are still disputed or uncovered. However, to achieve definite and direct cure of AD, researchers attention [MASK] been drawn towards exploration  of new therapeutics targets. In this review, we have discussed the current progress of various aspects of pathophysiological mechanisms behind AD, together  with recent investigational therapeutic approaches and present tools with an emp[MASK]is on Multi Target Directed Drugs approach. METHOD: We have scrutinized numerous peer-reviewed research articles to assemble  and discuss significant research findings and success achieved in the last decade pertinent to the application of Multi-Target Directed Drugs in the treatment of AD. RESULTS: The main emp[MASK]is of the review was to understand the various aspects of pathophysiological mechanisms involved in AD, along with the recent developments  on potential AD targets and application of Multi-Target Directed Drugs approach against AD. In addition, a brief overview of major drawbacks of conventional anti-AD drugs [MASK] also been included. We found that several strategies including  in silico approach could be used for multi-target drug designing against AD. However, various synthetic/natural compounds and nano-formulations have the ability to be developed as multi-target drugs for AD. CONCLUSION: The present review comprises imperative information regarding AD pathology and disease process along with recent researches going on to develop treatment strategies against AD. Thus, this review might be helpful for physician, neurologist and scientist in understanding the diverse roots of AD for designing primary cure skills and scaffold of pharmacological treatment to manage AD.

      "[CLS] The recent progress in the development of in vivo biomarkers is rapidly changing  how neurodegenerative diseases are conceptualized and diagnosed, and how clinical trials are designed today. Alzheimers disease (AD)-the most common neurodegenerative disorder-is characterized by a complex neuropathology involving the deposition of extracellular amyloid-ß (Aß) plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins, accompanied by the activation of glial cells-astrocytes and microglia-and neuroinflammatory responses, leading to neurodegeneration and cognitive dysfunction. An increasing  diversity of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging radio[MASK] are available to selectively target the different pathophysiological processes of AD. Along with the success of Aß PET and the more recent tau PET imaging, there is also a great interest to develop PET [MASK] to image glial activation and neuroinflammation. While most research to date has focused on imaging microgliosis, recent studies using 11C-deuterium-L-deprenyl (11C-DED) PET imaging suggest that astrocytosis may be present from very early stages of disease development in AD. This chapter provides a detailed description of the practical  approach used for the analysis of 11C-DED PET imaging data in a multitracer PET paradigm including 11C-Pittsburgh compound B (11C-PiB) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG). The multitracer PET approach allows investigating the comparative regional and temporal patterns of in vivo brain astrocytosis, fibrillar Aß deposition, and glucose metabolism in patients at different stages of disease progression. This chapter attempts to stimulate further research in the field, including the development of novel PET [MASK] that may allow visualizing different aspects of the complex astrocytic and microglial responses in neurodegenerative diseases. Progress in the field will contribute to the incorporation of PET imaging of glial activation and neuroinflammation as biomarkers with clinical application, and motivate further investigation on glial cells as therapeutic targets in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.

The prevailing model derives from animal research and [MASK] physical activity directly affecting brain physiology by increasing brain volume, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF),  and hippocampal neurogenesis with consequent gains in neuropsychological test scores. Supporting evidence [MASK] been mixed, with physical-activity-related gains  across multiple neuropsychological domains considered indicative of the protective effect. Hippocampal-mediated delayed memory functioning is the first neurocognitive skill to be impaired in the early stages of Alzheimer disease, and physical-activity-related gains on delayed memory measures would provide the strongest support for the model. RESULTS: Review of 26 randomized controlled trials with nonclinical older, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia participants found only one with significant physical-activity-related gains in delayed memory compared to controls. This evidence does not support the physiological brain change model. Similarly, there  is questionable support from those randomized controlled trials that have measured physical-activity-related brain volume and blood BDNF levels (neurogenesis having no valid labeling technique in living humans).

      "[CLS] The amyloid-ß (Aß) peptide has long been considered to be the driving force behind Alzheimers disease (AD). However, clinical trials that have successfully  reduced Aß burden in the brain have not slowed the cognitive decline, and in some instances, have resulted in adverse outcomes. While these results [MASK] be interpreted in different ways, a more nuanced picture of Aß is emerging that takes into account the facts that the peptide is evolutionarily conserved and is  present throughout life in cognitively normal individuals. Recent evidence indicates a role for Aß as an antimicrobial peptide (AMP), a class of innate immune defense molecule that utilizes fibrillation to protect the host from a wide range of infectious agents. In humans and in animal models, infection of the brain frequently leads to increased amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid-ß protein precursor (AßPP) and resultant fibrillary aggregates of Aß. Evidence from in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrates that Aß oligomers have potent, broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties by forming fibrils that entrap pathogens  and disrupt cell membranes. Importantly, overexpression of Aß confers increased resistance to infection from both bacteria and viruses. The antimicrobial role of Aß may explain why increased rates of infection have been observed in some of the AD clinical trials that depleted Aß. Perhaps progress toward a cure for AD will accelerate once treatment strategies begin to take into account the likely physiological functions of this enigmatic peptide. [SEP]\t\tcan\n",

Cholinergic brain imaging may provide [MASK] insights into the viability of this hypothesis. Recent findings: Cholinergic receptor and forebrain volumetric studies suggest an important role of the cholinergic system in maintaining brain network integrity that may deteriorate with cognitive decline in Alzheimer disease (AD) and Lewy body disorders (LBD). Bidirectional changes in regional receptor expression may suggest the presence of compensatory responses to neurodegenerative injury. Cholinergic system changes are more complex in LBD because of additional subcortical degenerations compared to AD.

In this study, we found that ROS formation and expression of p47phox and p67phox, subunits of NADPH oxidase, were increased in AppTg mice but attenuated in AppTg/Cebpd-/- mice. Cebpd can up-regulate p47phox and p67phox transcription via  a direct binding on their promoters, which results in an increase in [MASK] oxidative stress. In addition, Cebpd also up-regulated Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (Sod1) in astrocytes. Inactivation of Sod1 increased the sensitization to oxidative stress, which provides a reason for the resistance of  astrocytes in an oxidative stress environment. Taken together, the study first revealed and dissected the involvement of astrocytic Cebpd in the promotion of oxidative stress and the contribution of CEBPD to the resistance of astrocytes in an oxidative stress environment.

      "[CLS] The pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 homology 3 domain only ([MASK]) proteins are central regulators of cell death in various physiological and pathological conditions, including Alzheimers disease (AD). Bcl-2 modifying factor (Bmf) is one such [MASK] protein that is implicated in various death paradigms such as anoikis, seizures, cancer and autoimmunity. It also co-operates with other [MASK] proteins such as Bim in various death paradigms. However, its role in neurodegeneration is under-investigated. Here, we report for the first time the essential role of Bmf and its co-operativity with direct activator [MASK] proteins Bim and Puma in neuron death induced by beta-amyloid (Aß) toxicity or NGF deprivation. Oligomeric Aß is main pathologic species in AD and NGF deprivation is relevant for both developmental as well as pathologic neuron death. We find that Bmf over-expression causes cell death and Bmf knockdown protects neurons against death evoked by Aß or NGF deprivation. We also find that Bmf co-operates with other important [MASK] proteins such as Bim and Puma in neuron death induced by Aß or NGF deprivation. Simultaneous knocking down of these molecules by their respective shRNAs provide enhanced protection against Aß. Taken together, our results elucidate the essential role of Bmf and its co-operative effects with already known neuron death inducers, Bim and Puma, in neuron death evoked by Aß treatment or NGF deprivation.

      "[CLS] INTRODUCTION: Exploring the role of Alzheimers disease (AD) implicated pathways  in the predementia phase may provide new [MASK] for preventive and clinical trials targeting disease specific pathways. METHODS: We constructed weighted Genetic risk scores, first based on 20 genome-wide significant AD risk variants and second clustering these variants within pathways. Risk scores were investigated for their association with AD, mild cognitive impairment, and brain magnetic resonance imaging phenotypes including white matter lesions, hippocampal volume, and brain volume. RESULTS: The risk score capturing endocytosis pathway was significantly associated with mild cognitive impairment (P = 1.44 × 10-4). Immune response (P = .016) and clathrin/AP2 adaptor complex pathway (P = 3.55 × 10-3) excluding apolipoprotein E also showed modest association with white matter lesions but did not sustain Bonferroni correction (P = 9.09 × 10-4). DISCUSSION: Our study suggests that the clinical spectrum of early AD pathology is explained by different biological pathways, in particular, the endocytosis, clathrin/AP2 adaptor complex, and immune response pathways, that are independent  of apolipoprotein E (APOE).

      "[CLS] The synaptic vesicle cycle (SVC) holds center stage in the biology of presynaptic terminals. Through recurrent exocytosis and endocytosis, it facilitates a sequence of events enabling chemical neurotransmission between functionally related neurons. As a fundamental process that links the interior of nerve cells  with their environment, the SVC is also critical for signaling and provides an entry route for a range of pathogens and toxins, enabling detrimental effects. In Alzheimers disease, the SVC is both the prime site of amyloid ß production and toxicity. In this study, we discuss the emerging evidence for physiological and pathological effects of Aß on [MASK] stages of the SVC, from postfusion membrane recovery to trafficking, docking, and priming of vesicles for fusion and transmitter release. Understanding of the mechanisms of Aß interaction with the SVC within the unifying calcium hypothesis of aging and Alzheimers disease should further elucidate the fundamental biology of the presynaptic terminal and  reveal novel therapeutic targets for Alzheimers disease and other age-related dementias.

Multilevel analyses examined relationships [MASK] greenness, as measured by mean Normalized Difference Vegetation Index from satellite imagery at the Census block level, and each of two mental health outcomes; Alzheimers disease and depression, respectively, after statistically adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, and neighborhood income level of the individuals. Higher  block-level greenness was linked to better mental health outcomes: There was a reduced risk of Alzheimers disease (by 18%) and depression (by 28%) for beneficiaries living in blocks that were 1 SD above the mean for greenness, as compared to blocks that were 1 SD below the mean. Planned post-hoc analyses revealed that higher levels of greenness were associated with even greater mental health benefits in low-income neighborhoods: An increase in greenness from 1 SD below to 1 SD above the mean was associated with 37% lower odds of depression in  low-income neighborhoods, compared to 27% and 21% lower odds of depression in medium- and high-income neighborhoods, respectively. Greenness may be effective in promoting mental health in older adults, particularly in low-income neighborhoods, possibly as a result of the increased opportunities for physical activity, social interaction, or stress mitigation.

      "[CLS] Telomeres are the protective end caps of chromosomes and shorten with every cell  division. Telomere length has been proposed as a biomarker of biological age and  a risk factor for age-related diseases. Epidemiologic studies show an association between leukocyte [MASK] length (LTL) and mortality. There is solid evidence that links LTL with cardiovascular disease. Short [MASK]s promote atherosclerosis and impair the repair of vascular lesions. Alzheimers disease patients have also a reduced LTL. Telomeres measured in tumor tissue from breast, colon and prostate are shorter than in healthy tissue from the same organ and the same patient. In healthy tissue directly adjacent to these tumors, [MASK]s are  also shorter than in cells that are more distant from the cancerous lesion. A reduced [MASK] length in cancer tissue from breast, colon and prostate is associated with an advanced disease state at diagnosis, faster disease progression and poorer survival. By contrast, results regarding LTL and cancer are inconsistent. Furthermore, the majority of studies did not find significant associations between LTL, bone mineral density (BMD) and osteoporosis.

      "[CLS] Oxidative stress is a major mechanism underlying the development of various neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer, Parkinson, Huntington and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). Excessive formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitrogen (RNSs) can overburden the ability of the enzymatic antioxidant defense mechanisms (superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione reductase) and non-enzymatic (uric acid, ascorbic acid, a-tocopherol and reduced glutathione), causing the development of oxidative stress, and consequently, impairing the neuronal system cells by means of oxidative damage to a variety of important biological molecules such as lipids, DNA and proteins.

      "[CLS] In the last few years, increased emphasis has been devoted to understanding the contribution of mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes (MAM) to human pathology in general, and neurodegenerative diseases in particular. A major reason for this is the central role that this subdomain of the ER plays in metabolic regulation and in mitochondrial biology. As such, aberrant MAM function may help explain the seemingly unrelated metabolic abnormalities often seen in neurodegeneration. In the specific case of Alzheimer  disease (AD), besides perturbations in calcium and lipid homeostasis, there are numerous documented alterations in mitochondrial behavior and function, including reduced respiratory chain activity and oxidative phosphorylation, increased free  radical production, and altered organellar morphology, dynamics, and positioning  (especially perinuclear mitochondria). However, whether these alterations are primary [MASK] causative of the disease, or are secondary downstream [MASK] that  are the result of some other, more fundamental problem, is still unclear. In support of the former possibility, we recently reported that C99, the C-terminal  processing product of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) derived from its cleavage by ß-secretase, is present in MAM, that its level is increased in AD, and that this increase reduces mitochondrial respiration, likely via a C99-induced alteration in cellular sphingolipid homeostasis. Thus, the metabolic  disturbances seen in AD likely arise from increased ER-mitochondrial communication that is driven by an increase in the levels of C99 at the MAM. [SEP]\t\tevents\n",

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Dementia due to Alzheimers disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are the two most common neurodegenerative causes of dementia. They commonly occur together, especially in older people, but clinical identification  of these diseases in dementia is difficult in such circumstances. We therefore conducted a study using cases with both comprehensive prospective clinical assessments and complete neuropathological examination to determine if it is possible to identify such mixed cases clinically and to determine features which  may identify DLB in the presence of AD dementia. METHODS: At Newcastle Brain Bank we identified subjects who had a clinical diagnosis of dementia and who also had autopsy diagnoses of pure AD, pure DLB, or mixed AD+DLB. All subjects had undergone prospective longitudinal clinical assessments. Mixed AD+DLB patients met neuropathological criteria for both DLB (limbic/neocortical Lewy body disease) and AD (Braak stage V/VI and CERAD B/C). The records of these subjects were carefully reviewed by two specialists in old-age psychiatry blind to autopsy findings to determine baseline and final clinical diagnoses based on these detailed records. The presence of characteristic Lewy body symptoms and other clinical information was also [MASK] RESULTS: Of 59 subjects included, 19 were AD, 18 DLB, and 22 mixed AD+DLB. At baseline no subjects were correctly identified as having mixed AD+DLB and by final diagnosis only 23% were identified. The only symptom which helped in identifying the presence of Lewy body disease in the context of a mixed AD+DLB dementia was complex visual hallucinations. CONCLUSIONS: Whilst the identification of DLB in the context of a dementia with an AD pattern is difficult, the emergence of complex visual hallucinations in the context of such a degenerative dementia suggests the presence of Lewy body disease and should encourage a careful assessment. Biomarkers appear likely to be necessary to help improve identification of different disease subtypes underlying dementia. [SEP]\t\trecorded.\n",

Dementia is associated with various risk factors and conditions such as insufficient cerebral blood supply, toxin exposure, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative damage, and often coexisting with some neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimers disease (AD), Huntingtons disease (HD), and Parkinsons disease (PD). Although there are well-established (semi-)synthetic drugs currently used for the management of AD and AD-associated dementia, most of them have several adverse effects. Thus, traditional medicine provides various plant-derived lead molecules that may be useful for further medical research. Herein we review the worldwide use of ethnomedicinal plants in dementia treatment. We have explored a number of recognized databases by using keywords and phrases such as \"dementia\", \"Alzheimers,\" \"traditional medicine,\" \"ethnopharmacology,\" \"ethnobotany,\" \"herbs,\" \"medicinal plants\" or other relevant terms, and summarized 90 medicinal  plants that are traditionally used to treat dementia.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Neuroinflammation has gained increasing attention as a potential contributing factor in Alzheimers disease ([MASK]) pathology. A clinical cerebrospinal fluid biomarker capable of monitoring this process during the course of the disease has yet to emerge, chiefly owing to contradictory research  findings. In this study, we sought to clarify the utility of inflammatory biomarkers in diagnostic procedures of [MASK] in three steps: (1) to screen for proteins that are robustly detectable in cerebrospinal fluid; (2) based on this analysis, to explore any associations between the analytically robust markers and salient pathological features of [MASK]; and (3) to determine the discriminative power of these markers in the clinical diagnosis of [MASK]. METHODS: From a total of 46 proteins, 15 that were robustly detectable in cerebrospinal fluid were identified. A subsequent analysis of these markers in a  cohort of 399 patients (nondemented subjects, patients with mild cognitive impairment [MCI], and patients with [MASK], supplemented by smaller cohorts of other  diseases) was conducted. Fluid biomarker data were related to [MASK] pathology and neuropsychological markers and adjusted for confounders such as age, sex, apolipoprotein E genotype, and biobank storage time. RESULTS: Cerebrospinal fluid levels of C-reactive protein and soluble TREM2 differed between nondemented subjects, patients with MCI, or patients with [MASK] and were associated with amyloid and tau pathology. Several markers were associated with tau pathology only or with other neurodegenerative diseases. Correlations between neuropsychological performance and inflammatory markers were weak, but they were most prominent in [MASK] and for the most challenging cognitive tests. All  investigated covariates had significant influence, with varying effects across the markers. Still, none of the markers achieved discriminative power of more than 70% to distinguish between patient groups defined by clinical or neuropathological categories. CONCLUSIONS: Basic analytical considerations proved indispensable for this type of study because only one-third of the tested markers were robustly detectable in cerebrospinal fluid. Detectable inflammatory protein markers were associated in multiple ways with [MASK] pathology. Yet, even significantly associated markers were  not powerful enough in terms of effect strength, sensitivity, and specificity, and hence they were not suited for direct use in clinical diagnostic practice. Targets other than those most commonly considered in this field of research might provide results with better clinical applicability. [SEP]\t\tAD\n",

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies of Alzheimers disease (AD) have identified a number of significant risk loci, [MASK] majority of which lie in non-coding regions of [MASK] genome. The lack of causal alleles and considerable polygenicity remains a significant barrier to translation into mechanistic understanding. This includes identifying causal variants and [MASK] cell/tissue types in which [MASK]y operate. A fuller understanding of [MASK] cell types and transcriptional networks involved in AD genetic risk mechanisms will provide important insights into pathogenesis. METHODS: We assessed [MASK] significance of [MASK] overlap between genome-wide significant AD risk variants and sites of open chromatin from data sets representing diverse tissue types. We [MASK]n focussed on macrophages and microglia  to investigate [MASK] role of open chromatin sites containing motifs for specific transcription factors. Partitioned heritability using LDscore regression was used to investigate [MASK] contribution of specific macrophage and microglia transcription factor motif-containing open chromatin sites to [MASK] heritability of AD. RESULTS: AD risk single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are preferentially located at sites of open chromatin in immune cells, particularly monocytes (z score = 4.43; corrected P = 5.88 × 10- 3). Similar enrichments are observed for macrophages (z score = 4.10; corrected P < 2.40 × 10- 3) and microglia (z score = 4.34, corrected P = 0.011). In both macrophages and microglia, AD risk variants are enriched at a subset of open chromatin sites that contain DNA binding motifs  for specific transcription factors, e.g. SPI1 and MEF2. Genetic variation at many of [MASK]se motif-containing sites also mediate a substantial proportion of AD heritability, with SPI1-containing sites capturing [MASK] majority of [MASK] common variant SNP-chip heritability (microglia enrichment = 16.28, corrected enrichment P = 0.0044). CONCLUSIONS: AD risk alleles plausibly operate in immune cells, including microglia, and are concentrated in specific transcriptional networks. Combined with primary genetic association results, [MASK] SPI1 and MEF2 transcriptional networks appear central to AD risk mechanisms. Investigation of transcription factors targeting AD risk SNP associated regulatory elements could provide powerful insights into [MASK] molecular processes affected by AD polygenic risk. More broadly, our findings support a model of polygenic disease risk that arises  from variants located in specific transcriptional networks. [SEP]\t\tthe\n",

Objective: To assess whether a sporadic parental estimated years to symptom onset calculation could be used to identify information about amyloid-ß (Aß) levels in  asymptomatic individuals with a parental history of AD dementia. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study analyzed Aß1-42 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens from 101 cognitively normal individuals who had a lumbar puncture as part of the Presymptomatic Evaluation of Novel or Experimental Treatments for Alzheimer Disease (PREVENT-AD) cohort from September  1, 2011, through November 30, 2016 (374 participants were enrolled in the cohort  during this period). The study estimated each participants proximity to his/her  parents symptom onset by subtracting the index relatives onset age from his/her current age. The association between proximity to parental symptom onset and Aß levels was then assessed using apolipoprotein E e4 (APOE4) status and sex as interactive terms. These analyses were performed again in 2 independent cohorts using CSF and Pittsburgh compound [MASK] carbon 11-labeled positron emission tomography (PI[MASK]-PET) Aß biomarkers: the Adult Children Study (ACS) and the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer Prevention (WRAP) cohorts. Main Outcomes and Measures: The association between proximity to parental symptom onset and Aß burden in asymptomatic individuals with a parental history of sporadic AD. Results: The present analysis included a subset of 101 PREVENT-AD individuals (mean [SD] age, 61.8 [5.1] years; 30 [29.7%] male), 128 ACS participants (112 participants underwent CSF measurement: mean [SD] age, 63.4 [5.1] years; 31 [27.7%] male; and 107 underwent PI[MASK]-PET: mean [SD] age, 64.6 [5.3] years; 27 [25.2%] male), and 135 WRAP participants (85 participants underwent CSF measurement: mean [SD] age, 59.9 [6.0] years; 27 [31.8%] male; and 135 underwent  PI[MASK]-PET: mean [SD] age, 59.6 [6.1] years; 43 [31.9%] male). In the PREVENT-AD cohort, individuals approaching their parents onset age had lower CSF Aß1-42 levels (range, 402-1597; [MASK]?=?-9.09, P?=?.04). This association was stronger in APOE4 carriers ([MASK]?=?-17.9, P?=?.03) and women ([MASK]?=?-19.8, P?=?.02). In the ACS cohort, the main association was replicated using PI[MASK]-PET data, and the sex interaction was replicated using CSF and PI[MASK]-PET data. In the WRAP cohort, the results were not replicated using cross-sectional data, but the main association  and the APOE interaction were replicated using PI[MASK]-PET longitudinal data.

      "[CLS] a-Synuclein aggregation has been linked to Gauchers disease (GD) and Krabbes disease (KD), lysosomal conditions affecting glycosphingolipid metabolism. a-Synuclein pathology has been directly attributed to the dysregulation of glycosphingolipids in both conditions, specifically to increased galactosylsphingosine (psychosine) content in the context of KD. Furthermore, the gene ([MASK]) coding for the psychosine degrading enzyme galactosylceramidase ([MASK]), has recently been identified as a risk loci for Parkinsons disease. However, it is unknown if changes in psychosine metabolism and [MASK] activity in the context of the aging human brain correlate with Parkinsons disease. We investigated psychosine accumulation and [MASK] activity in the aging brain using fresh frozen post-mortem tissue from Parkinsons (PD, n = 10), Alzheimers (AD, n = 10), and healthy control patients (n = 9), along with tissue from neuropsychiatric patients (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression, n = 15 each). An expanded mutational analysis of PD (n = 20), AD (n = 10), and healthy controls (n = 30) examined if PD was correlated with carriers for severe [MASK] mutations. Psychosine content within the cerebral cortex of PD patients was elevated above control patients.

Furthermore, we found that kidney function influences Aß40 and Aß42 plasma levels, but not Aß42/40 level. Liver function, age, and sex do not affect Aß levels in plasma. [SEP]\t\tof\n",

      "[CLS] The pathomechanism of Alzheimers disease (AD) certainly involves mitochondrial disturbances, glutamate excitotoxicity, and neuroinflammation. The three main aspects of mitochondrial dysfunction in AD, i.e., the defects in dynamics, altered bioenergetics, and the deficient transport, act synergistically. In addition, glutamatergic neurotransmission is affected in several ways. The balance between synaptic and extrasynaptic glutamatergic transmission is shifted  toward the extrasynaptic site contributing to glutamate excitotoxicity, a phenomenon augmented by increased glutamate release and decreased glutamate uptake. Neuroinflammation in AD is predominantly linked to central players of the innate immune system, with central nervous system (CNS)-resident microglia, astroglia, and perivascular macrophages having been implicated at the cellular level. Several abnormalities have been described regarding the activation of certain steps of the kynurenine (KYN) pathway of tryptophan metabolism in AD. First of all, the activation of indolamine 2,3-dioxygenase, the first and rate-limiting step of the pathway, is well-demonstrated. 3-Hydroxy-L-KYN and its  metabolite, 3-hydroxy-anthranilic acid have pro-oxidant, antioxidant, and potent  immunomodulatory features, giving relevance to their alterations in AD. Another metabolite, quinolinic acid, has been demonstrated to be neurotoxic, promoting glutamate excitotoxicity, reactive oxygen species production, lipid peroxidation, and microglial neuroinflammation, and its abundant presence in AD pathologies has been demonstrated. Finally, the neuroprotective metabolite, kynurenic acid, has been associated with antagonistic [MASK] at glutamate receptors, free radical scavenging, and immunomodulation, giving rise to potential therapeutic implications. This review presents the multiple connections of KYN pathway-related alterations to three main domains of AD pathomechanism, such as mitochondrial dysfunction, excitotoxicity, and neuroinflammation, implicating possible therapeutic options.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Trajectories of complex neurocognitive phenotypes in preclinical aging may be produced differentially through selective and interactive combinations of genetic risk. OBJECTIVE: We organize three possible combinations into a \"network\" of genetic risk indices derived from polymorphisms associated with normal and impaired cognitive aging, as well as Alzheimers disease (AD). Specifically, we assemble and examine three genetic clusters relevant to non-demented cognitive trajectories: 1) Apolipoprotein E (APOE), 2) a Cognitive Aging Genetic Risk Score (CA-GRS; Catechol-O-methyltransferase + Brain-derived neurotrophic factor), and 3) an AD-Genetic Risk Score (AD-GRS; Clusterin + [MASK] receptor 1?+?Phosphatidylinositol-binding clathrin assembly protein). METHOD: We use an accelerated longitudinal design (n?=?634; age range?=?55-95 years) to test whether AD-GRS (low versus high) moderates the effect of increasing CA-GRS risk on executive function (EF) performance and change as stratified by APOE status (?4+ versus ?4-). RESULTS: APOE?4 carriers with high AD-GRS had poorer EF performance at the centering age (75 years) and steeper 9-year decline with increasing CA-GRS but this association was not present in APOE?4 carriers with low AD-GRS. CONCLUSIONS: APOE?4 carriers with high AD-GRS are at elevated risk of cognitive decline when they also possess higher CA-GRS risk. Genetic risk from both common  cognitive aging and AD-related indices may interact in intensification networks to differentially predict (1) level and trajectories of EF decline and (2) potential selective vulnerability for transitions into impairment and dementia.

      "[CLS] Excessive amyloid beta (Aß) deposition in brain is mainly responsible for cell damage and blood-brain barrier [MASK] disruption in Alzheimers disease (AD). Catalpol, an iridoid glucoside extracted from the root of Rehmannia glutinosa Libosch, has neuroprotective effect against AD. It is unclear whether catalpol has a protective effect on Aß-induced BBB leakage. We employed an immortalized endothelial cell line (bEnd.3) and astrocytes co-culture to mimic a BBB model in  vitro and investigated the effect of catalpol on BBB. We found that treatment with catalpol decreased BBB hyperpermeability induced by fibrillar Aß1-42 . Data  from western blotting showed that catalpol prevented fibrillar Aß1-42 -induced bEnd.3 cell apoptosis through mitochondria-dependent and death receptor pathways; decreased the levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), MMP-2, MMP-9, and the receptor for advanced glycation end products; and increased the levels of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-5), low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1, and P-glycoprotein in fibrillar Aß1-42 -treated bEnd.3 cells. Moreover, catalpol also enhanced soluble Aß efflux across the fibrillar Aß1-42 -treated bEnd.3 cells BBB monolayer model. Altogether, our results suggest that catalpol alleviate fibrillar Aß1-42 -induced BBB disruption, enhance soluble Aß clearance, and offer a feasible therapeutic application in AD  treatment.

      "[CLS] Neurological diseases, including dementias such as Alzheimers disease (AD) and fronto-temporal dementia (FTD) and degenerative motor neuron diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), are responsible for an increasing fraction of worldwide fatalities. Researching these heterogeneous diseases requires models that endogenously express the full array of genetic and epigenetic factors which  may influence disease development in both familial and sporadic patients. Here, we discuss the two primary methods of developing patient-derived neurons and glia to model neurodegenerative disease: reprogramming somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which are differentiated into neurons or glial cells, or directly converting (DC) somatic cells into neurons (iNeurons) or glial cells. Distinct differentiation techniques for both models result in a variety of neuronal and glial cell types, which have been successful in displaying unique hallmarks of a variety of neurological diseases. Yield, length of differentiation, ease of genetic [MASK] expression of cell-specific markers, and recapitulation of disease pathogenesis are presented as determining  factors in how these methods may be used separately or together to ascertain mechanisms of disease and identify therapeutics for distinct patient populations  or for specific individuals in personalized medicine projects.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Alzheimers disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid beta [MASK] plaques, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and cognitive impairment. Literature cites the role of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in AD due to increased cytotoxicity via oxidative stress. d-galactose (d-gal) induced amnesia stimulates Aß overproduction via increased oxidative stress and AGEs. Trigonelline (TRG), a  naturally occurring alkaloid has been reported to have neuroprotective and antidiabetic properties. METHODS: Present study assessed the protective effect of TRG against in vitro AGEs formation. Since chronic administration of d-gal increases AGEs, we subsequently investigated the neuroprotective role of TRG (50 and 100?mg/kg as per body weight) against d-gal induced amnesia. Mice were subcutaneously (sc) injected with d-gal (150?mg/kg) for 6 weeks. Behavioral assessments in Morris water maze (MWM) and Y-maze were performed, followed by biochemical estimations to deduce the probable mechanism of action. RESULTS: In vitro experiments demonstrated that TRG stalled early and late AGEs formation. Chronic d-gal administration significantly impaired cognitive performance in MWM and Y maze, caused marked oxidative damage, elevated the AGEs  levels and significantly increased the acetylcholinesterase levels as compared to sham group. TRG (50 and 100?mg/kg) treatment significantly ameliorated cognitive  performance, reversed the oxidative damage, decreased AGE levels and caused significant decline in acetylcholine esterase levels as compared to d-gal group. CONCLUSION: Present study highlights the neuroprotective role of TRG against d-gal induced amnesia due to the antioxidant, antiglycative and anticholinesterase properties. [SEP]\t\t(Aß)\n",

A particularly attractive therapeutic strategy is to selectively prevent the disruptive effects of activation of the innate immune system in the brain at an early transitional stage by [MASK] the production or directly neutralizing pro-inflammatory cytokines, in particular IL-1ß and TNF-a. Here we tested their in vivo effects on synaptic plasticity deficits, which provide sensitive and robust measures of synaptic failure, in a rat model of AD amyloidosis. Using electrophysiological techniques we longitudinally studied the effects of the NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor Mcc950, the IL-1 receptor antagonist (anakinra) and an anti-TNF-a agent (etanercept) in awake freely moving transgenic rats overexpressing AD associated  ß-amyloid precursor protein at a pre-plaque stage of amyloidosis. Repeated treatment with Mcc950 reversibly abrogated the inhibition of long-term potentiation. The IL-1 receptor antagonist and etanercept also had a similar beneficial effect on the deficit in synaptic plasticity.

      "[CLS] The quantitative analysis of polyunsaturated fatty acyl (PUFA) chain oxidation products in tissue samples by mass spectrometry is [MASK] by the lack of durable internal standards for the large number of possible products. To address  this problem in a study of oxidative PUFA degradation in Alzheimers disease (AD) brain, uniformly 13C-labeled arachidonic acid (ARA) was produced biosynthetically, and allowed to oxidize under controlled conditions into a mixture of U-13C-labeled ARA oxidation products. The components of this mixture were characterized with respect to their partitioning behavior during lipid extraction, their durability during saponification, trends in mouse brain tissue  concentrations during post mortem intervals, and their overall suitability as internal standards for multiple-reaction monitoring tandem mass spectrometry. This mixture has now been used as a set of internal standards to determine the relative abundance of ARA and 54 non-stereospecific oxidation products in milligram samples of brain tissue. Many of these oxidation products were recovered from both healthy mouse and healthy human brain, although some of them  were unique to each source, and some have not heretofore been described. The list of oxidation products detected in AD brain tissue was the same as in healthy human brain, although simple hydroxy-eicosanoids were significantly increased in  AD brain. while more complex oxidation products were not. These results are consistent with an increased level of chemically-mediated oxidative ARA degradation in Alzheimers disease.

      "[CLS] In mild cognitive impairment (MCI), the APOE4 genotype is associated with accelerated memory decline, likely due to the impact of neuropathology on main cerebral networks required for successful memory retrieval and/or to decreased [MASK] for recruiting secondary networks that might compensate for that brain damage. Here, we tested this hypothesis in twenty-six healthy older adults and thirty-four MCI patients, of which sixteen were APOE4 carriers. Compared to controls, MCI showed hippocampal volume reduction, cortical thinning in frontal,  temporal and parietal regions, and dysfunctional EEG oscillations across fronto-temporal networks. But importantly, APOE4 status was the critical factor in determining the impact of temporal lobe degeneration on memory in MCI individuals. Specifically, path analyses revealed that hippocampal damage in MCI  was responsible for memory deterioration in APOE4 carriers, a relationship mediated by the serial intervention of three related factors in noncarriers. Temporal cortical thickness (first mediator) accounted for activation of functional networks through synchronized theta activity across temporal regions (second mediator), which, in turn, coordinated memory reactivation through desynchronized alpha/beta activity across sensorimotor areas (third mediator). Results revealed that, contrary to APOE4-carrier patients, noncarriers are successful in recruiting secondary cortical networks to improve memory performance as long as the integrity and functionality of the temporal lobe is preserved, a fact primarily dependent on hippocampal degeneration.

In this study, we further explored the effects of  a novel unimolecular GLP-1/GIP/Gcg triagonist on the cognitive behavior and cerebral pathology in the 7-month-old triple transgenic mouse model of AD (3xTg-AD), and investigated its possible electrophysiological and molecular mechanisms. After chronic administration of the GLP-1/GIP/Gcg triagonist (10 nmol/kg bodyweight, once daily, i.p.) for 30 days, open field, Y maze and Morris  water maze tests were performed, followed by in vivo electrophysiological recording, immunofluorescence and Western blotting experiments. We found that the chronic treatment with the triagonist could improve long-term spatial memory of 3xTg-AD mice in Morris water maze, as well as the working memory in Y maze task.  The triagonist also alleviated the suppression of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 region of hippocampus. In addition, the triagonist significantly reduced  hippocampal pathological damages, including amyloid-ß (Aß) and phosphorylated tau aggregates, and upregulated the expression levels of [MASK] p-CREB, T286 p-CAMKII and S9 p-GSK3ß in the hippocampus of the 3xTg-AD mice.

As a potent anti-amyloid and anti-inflammatory natural polyphenol, curcumin (Cur) could be potential therapies for AD. Unfortunately, poor solubility, instability  in physiological fluids, and low bioavailability limit its clinical utility. Recently, different lipid modifications in the formulae of Cur have been developed that would enhance its therapeutic [MASK] For example, we have reported greater permeability and neuroprotection with solid lipid curcumin particles (SLCP) than with natural Cur in an in vitro model of AD. In the present study, we compared the Aß aggregation inhibition, anti-amyloid, anti-inflammatory responses of Cur and or SLCP in both in vitro and in vivo models of AD. One-year-old 5xFAD-and age-matched wild-type mice were given intraperitoneal injections of Cur or SLCP (50 mg/kg body weight) for 2- or 5-days. Levels of Aß aggregation, including oligomers and fibril formation, were assessed by dot blot  assay, while Aß plaque load and neuronal morphology in the pre-frontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus were assayed by immunolabeling with Aß-specific antibody and cresyl violet staining, respectively. In addition, neuroinflammation was assessed the immunoreactivity (IR) of activated astrocytes (GFAP) and microglia (Iba-1) in different brain areas. Finally, comparisons of solubility and permeability of Cur and SLCP were made in cultured N2a cells and in primary hippocampal neurons derived from E16 pups of 5xFAD mice. RESULTS: We observed that relative to Cur, SLCP was more permeable, labeled Aß plaques more effectively, and produced a larger decrease in Aß plaque loads in PFC and dentate gyrus (DG) of hippocampus. Similarly, relative to Cur, SLCP produced a larger decrease of pyknotic, or tangle-like, neurons in PFC, CA1, and  CA3 areas of hippocampus after 5 days of treatment. Both Cur and or SLCP significantly reduced GFAP-IR and Iba-1-IR in PFC, in the striatum as well as CA1, CA3, DG, subicular complex of hippocampus, and the entorhinal cortex in the  5xFAD mice after 5 days of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The use of SLCP provides more anti-amyloid, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective outcomes than does Cur in the 5xFAD mouse model of AD. [SEP]\t\tpotential.\n",

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Alzheimers disease and other forms of dementia are becoming increasingly common with the aging of most populations. The majority of individuals with dementia will first present for care and assessment in primary care settings. There is a need for brief dementia screening instruments that can  accurately diagnose dementia in primary care settings. The Mini-Cog is a brief, cognitive screening test that is frequently used to evaluate cognition in older adults in various settings. OBJECTIVES: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of the Mini-Cog for diagnosing Alzheimers disease dementia and related dementias in a primary care setting. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Register of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies, MEDLINE, Embase and four other databases, initially to September 2012. Since then, four updates to the search were performed using the same search methods, and the most recent was January 2017. We used citation tracking (using the databases related articles feature, where available) as an additional search method and contacted authors of eligible studies for unpublished data. SELECTION CRITERIA: We only [MASK] studies that evaluated the Mini-Cog as an index test for the diagnosis of Alzheimers disease dementia or related forms of  dementia when compared to a reference standard using validated criteria for dementia. We only [MASK] studies that were conducted in primary care populations. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We extracted and described information on the characteristics of the study participants and study setting. Using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) criteria we evaluated the quality of studies, and we assessed risk of bias and applicability of each study  for each domain in QUADAS-2. Two review authors independently extracted information on the true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives and entered the data into Review Manager 5 (RevMan 5). We then used RevMan 5 to determine the sensitivity, specificity, and 95% confidence intervals. We summarized the sensitivity and specificity of the Mini-Cog in the individual studies in forest plots and also plotted them in a receiver operating characteristic plot. We also created a Risk of bias and applicability concerns  graph to summarize information related to the quality of [MASK] studies. MAIN RESULTS: There were a total of four studies that met our inclusion criteria, including a total of 1517 total participants. The sensitivity of the Mini-Cog varied between 0.76 to 1.00 in studies while the specificity varied between 0.27  to 0.85. The [MASK] studies displayed significant heterogeneity in both methodologies and clinical populations, which did not allow for a meta-analysis to be completed. Only one study (Holsinger 2012) was found to be at low risk of bias on all methodological domains. The results of this study reported that the sensitivity of the Mini-Cog was 0.76 and the specificity was 0.73. We found the quality of all other [MASK] studies to be low due to a high risk of bias with methodological limitations primarily in their selection of participants. AUTHORS CONCLUSIONS: There is a limited number of studies evaluating the accuracy of the Mini-Cog for the diagnosis of dementia in primary care settings.  Given the small number of studies, the wide range in estimates of the accuracy of the Mini-Cog, and methodological limitations identified in most of the studies, at the present time there is insufficient evidence to recommend that the Mini-Cog be used as a screening test for dementia in primary care. Further studies are required to determine the accuracy of Mini-Cog in primary care and whether this tool has sufficient diagnostic test accuracy to be useful as a screening test in  this setting.

Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) and Acetylcholine (ACh) were also assessed using an immunohistochemical technique. RESULTS: Administration of TQ significantly improved cognition. In addition, TQ significantly increased SOD and TAC and decreased AChE activities.

Plate waste was measured by the nurses through the visual estimation method, and  by the hospitals registered dietitians through the actual measurement method. The actual measurement method was first validated to serve as a reference, and the level of agreement between both methods was then determined. The month, time  of day, type of food provided, and patients physical characteristics were considered for analysis. RESULTS: For the 3984 meals included in the analysis, the level of agreement between the measurement methods was 78.4%. Disagreement of measurements consisted of 3.8% of underestimation and 17.8% of overestimation.

RESULTS: Targeting the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) pathway, S14 rescued cognitive decline by improving hippocampal neurogenesis in APP/PS1 transgenic mice.

We aimed to develop an automatic image interpretation system based on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) which can accurately predict future cognitive decline in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients using flurodeoxyglucose and florbetapir  positron emission tomography (PET). PET images of 139 patients with AD, 171 patients with MCI and 182 normal subjects obtained from Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database were used. Deep CNN was trained using 3-dimensional PET volumes of AD and normal controls as inputs. Manually defined image feature extraction such as quantification using predefined region-of-interests was unnecessary for our approach. Furthermore, it used minimally processed images without spatial normalization which has been commonly  used in conventional quantitative analyses. Cognitive outcome of MCI subjects was predicted using this network. The prediction accuracy of the conversion of mild cognitive impairment to AD was compared with the conventional feature-based quantification approach. Accuracy of prediction (84.2%) for conversion to AD in MCI patients outperformed conventional feature-based quantification approaches. ROC analyses revealed that performance of CNN-based approach was significantly [MASK] than that of the conventional quantification methods (p?<?0.05). Output scores of the network were strongly correlated with the longitudinal change in cognitive measurements (p?<?0.05). These results show the feasibility of deep learning as a practical tool for developing predictive neuroimaging biomarker. [SEP]\t\thigher\n",

      "[CLS] Tau plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders: mutations in the gene encoding for tau (MAPT) are linked to Fronto-temporal Dementia (FTD) and hyper-phosphorylated aggregates of tau forming neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) that constitute a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD)  and FTD. Accordingly, tau is a favored therapeutic target for the treatment of these diseases. Given the criticality of tau to dementias pathogenesis and therapy, it is important to understand the physiological function of tau in the central nervous system. Analysis of Mapt knock out (Mapt-/-) mice has yielded inconsistent results. Some studies have shown that tau deletion [MASK] not alter memory while others have described synaptic plasticity and memory alterations in  Mapt-/- mice. To help clarifying these contrasting results, we analyzed a distinct Mapt-/- model on a B6129PF3/J genetic background. We found that tau deletion leads to aging-dependent short-term memory deficits, hyperactivity and synaptic plasticity defects. In contrast, Mapt+/- mice only showed a mild short memory deficit in the novel object recognition task. Thus, while tau is important for normal neuronal functions underlying learning and memory, partial reduction of tau expression may have fractional deleterious effects. [SEP]\t\tdoes\n",

      "[CLS] OBJECTIVE: To examine clinicopathologic correlations in early vs late age at onset frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). METHODS: All patients were clinically evaluated and prospectively diagnosed at the UCSF Memory and Aging Center. Two consecutive series were included: (1) patients with a clinically diagnosed FTD syndrome who underwent autopsy (cohort 1) and (2) patients with a primary pathologic diagnosis of FTLD, regardless of the clinical syndrome (cohort 2). These series were divided by age at symptom onset (cutoff 65 years). RESULTS: In cohort 1, 48 (25.3%) were 65 years or older at symptom onset. [MASK] causes of behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD) were similar in the early age at onset (EO) and late age at onset (LO) bvFTD groups. In corticobasal syndrome (CBS), however, the most common pathologic substrate differed according to age at onset: progressive supranuclear palsy (42.9%) in LO-CBS and Alzheimer disease (AD; 40.7%) in EO-CBS. In cohort 2, 57 (28.4%) were classified as LO-FTLD. Regarding FTLD major molecular classes, FTLD with transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa was most common in EO-FTLD (44.4%), whereas FTLD-tau (58.3%) was most common in LO-FTLD. Antemortem diagnosis of a non-FTD syndrome, usually AD-type dementia, was more frequent in LO-FTLD than EO-FTLD (19.3% vs 7.7%, p = 0.017). LO-FTLD was also associated with more prevalent comorbid pathologic changes. Of these, moderate to severe AD neuropathologic change and argyrophilic grain disease were overrepresented among patients who received an antemortem diagnosis of AD-type dementia. CONCLUSION: Patients with FTD and FTLD often develop symptoms after age 65, and age at onset represents an important consideration when making antemortem neuropathologic predictions.

      "[CLS] OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the statistical parametric mapping (SPM) procedure for fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET imaging as a possible single-subject marker of progression to dementia in Parkinson disease (PD). METHODS: Fifty-four consecutive patients with PD without dementia (age at onset of 59.9 ± 10.1 years, disease duration of 5.3 ± 3.4 years) entered the study. The patients underwent an extensive motor and cognitive assessment and a single-subject [MASK] SPM evaluation at baseline. A 4-year follow-up provided disease progression and dementia diagnosis. RESULTS: The [MASK] SPM was evaluated by 2 expert raters allowing the identification of a \"typical PD pattern\" in 29 patients, whereas 25 patients presented with \"atypical patterns,\" namely, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB)-like  (n = 12), Alzheimer disease (AD)-like (n = 6), corticobasal syndrome (CBS)-like (n = 5), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD)-like (n = 2). At 4-year follow-up, 13  patients, all showing atypical brain metabolic patterns at baseline, progressed to dementia (PD dementia). The DLB- and AD-like SPM patterns were the best predictor for incident dementia (p < 0.005, sensitivity 85%, specificity 88%), independently from demographics or cognitive baseline classification.

      "[CLS] Alzheimers disease (AD) is an increasingly pressing worldwide public-health, social, political and economic concern. Despite significant investment in multiple [MASK] therapeutic strategies that have achieved success in preclinical models addressing the pathological hallmarks of the disease, these efforts have not translated into any effective disease-modifying therapies. This  could be because interventions are being tested too late in the disease process.  While existing therapies provide symptomatic and clinical benefit, they do not fully address the molecular abnormalities that occur in AD neurons. The pathophysiology of AD is complex; mitochondrial bioenergetic deficits and brain hypometabolism coupled with increased mitochondrial oxidative stress are antecedent and potentially play a causal role in the disease pathogenesis. Dysfunctional mitochondria accumulate from the combination of impaired mitophagy, which can also induce injurious inflammatory responses, and inadequate neuronal mitochondrial biogenesis. Altering the metabolic capacity of the brain by modulating/potentiating its mitochondrial bioenergetics may be a strategy for disease prevention and treatment. We present insights into the mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction in AD brain as well as an overview of emerging treatments with the potential to prevent, delay or reverse the neurodegenerative  process by targeting mitochondria.

      "[CLS] Apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) is the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimers disease (AD), where inheritance of this isoform predisposes development of AD in a gene dose-dependent manner. Although the mode of action of ApoE4 on AD onset and progression remains unknown, we have previously shown that  ApoE4, and not ApoE3 expression, resulted in insulin signaling deficits in the presence of amyloid beta (Aß). However, these reports were not conducted with clinical samples that more accurately reflect human disease. In this study, we investigated the effect of ApoE genotype on the insulin signaling pathway in control and AD human brain samples. We found that targets of the insulin signaling pathway were attenuated in AD cases, regardless of ApoE isoform. We also found a decrease in GluR1 subunit expression, and an increase NR2B subunit expression in AD cases, regardless of ApoE isoform. Lastly, we observed that more insulin receptor ([MASK]) was immunoprecipitated in control cases, and more Aß was immunoprecipitated with AD cases. But, when comparing among AD cases, we found that more [MASK] was immunoprecipitated with ApoE3 than ApoE4, and more Aß was immunoprecipitated with ApoE4 than ApoE3. Our results suggest that the difference in [MASK] binding and effect on protein expression downstream of the [MASK] may affect onset and progression of AD. [SEP]\t\tIR\n",

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Alzheimers disease (AD) is a highly prevalent neurodegenerative disorder characterized by pathological hallmarks of beta-amyloid plaque deposits, tau pathology, inflammation, and cognitive decline. Treatment remains a clinical  obstacle due to lack of effective therapeutics. Agonists targeting nuclear receptors, such as bexarotene, reversed cognitive deficits regardless of [MASK] duration and age in murine models of AD. While bexarotene demonstrated  marked efficacy in decreasing plaque levels following short-term [MASK], prolonged [MASK] did not modulate plaque burden. This suggested that plaques might reform in mice treated chronically with bexarotene and that cessation of bexarotene [MASK] before plaques reform might alter amyloid pathology, inflammation, and cognition in AD mice. METHODS: We utilized one-year-old APP/PS1 mice that were divided into two groups. We treated one group of mice for 2 weeks with bexarotene. The other group of mice was treated for 2 weeks with bexarotene followed by withdrawal of drug [MASK]  for an additional 2 weeks. Cognition was evaluated using the novel-object recognition test either at the end of bexarotene [MASK] or the end of the withdrawal period. We then analyzed amyloid pathology and microgliosis at the conclusion of the study in both groups. RESULTS: Bexarotene [MASK] enhanced cognition in APP/PS1 mice similar to previous findings. Strikingly, we observed sustained cognitive improvements in mice in which bexarotene [MASK] was discontinued for 2 weeks. We observed a sustained reduction in microgliosis and plaque burden following drug withdrawal exclusively in the hippocampus. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that bexarotene selectively modifies aspects of neuroinflammation in a region-specific manner to reverse hippocampal-dependent cognitive deficits in AD mice and may provide insight to inform future studies with nuclear receptor agonists.

Longitudinal cohort studies reporting risk estimates of incident dementia or AD in the general population, and for three or  more quantitative categories of serum 25(OH)D were included. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using fixed-effects/random-effects models. RESULTS: Seven prospective cohort studies and one retrospective cohort study (total n?=?28,354) involving 1953 cases of dementia and 1607 cases of AD were included. The pooled HRs of dementia and AD were 1.09 (95%CI: 0.95, 1.24) and 1.19 (95%CI: 0.96, 1.41) for vitamin D insufficiency (10-20 ng/ml), and 1.33 (95%CI: 1.08, 1.58) and 1.31 (95%CI: 0.98, 1.65) for deficiency (<10 ng/ml), respectively. The lower risk of dementia was observed at serum 25(OH)D of ~25 ng/ml, whereas the risk of AD decreased continuously along with the increase  of serum 25(OH)D up to [MASK] ng/ml.

      "[CLS] Background: Katz Index is a well-known index for assessing basic activities of daily living. The aim was to determine validity and reliability of the Katz Index in Iranian patients with acute stroke. Methods: Eighty-seven patients (56 male, 31 female) with acute stroke (1-30 days post-stroke) participated in this psychometric properties study. Interval time for retest was 14 days. All participants were Iranian with Persian as native language, had no other major diseases (e.g. cancer, Alzheimer) and no psychiatric disorder. Cognitive mental score of all participants was above 18 (according to Mini-Mental State Examination). If they had another stroke during the following-up period, they were excluded from the study. Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), Standard  Error of Measurement (SEM) and Minimum Detectable Change (MDC) were calculated to investigate the reliability of the KI. Criterion validity of the KI was assessed  by Spearmans Correlation Coefficient (?). Moreover, Confirmatory [MASK] Analysis (CFA) and Exploratory [MASK] Analysis (EFA) were performed to investigate the construct validity of the KI. Results: Inter-rater and intra-rater reliability of Persian Katz Index were reasonable (ICC2,1=0.93, ICC2,1=0.83; respectively). Internal consistency of this index was high (cronbachs alpha=0.79). The high to  excellent correlation was found between Katz Index and the motion (?=0.88), self-care (?=0.98), and total scores (?=0.92) of Barthel Index.

      "[CLS] Increasing evidence indicates that altered reelin signaling could contribute to synaptic dysfunction in Alzheimers disease (AD). We found that reelin protein and mRNA levels were increased in the AD brain (particularly at advanced Braak stages in apolipoprotein E4 noncarriers), compared with that of control subjects. The ß-amyloid (Aß) protein impairs reelin activity and increases reelin expression through a mechanism that is not yet understood. To explore that mechanism, we examined the effect of Aß aa 1-42 (Aß42) on DNA methylation of the  RELN [MASK] and the processing of reelin receptor apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2) in differentiated SH-SY5Y cells because ApoER2 C-terminal fragments (CTFs), generated after reelin binding, regulate reelin expression. We found that Aß42 decreased nuclear levels of DNA-methyltransferase 1. However, RELN [MASK]  methylation did not change in Aß42-treated cells or in AD brain extracts. Instead, the levels of ApoER2-CTF appeared significantly lower in Aß42-treated cells and in AD extracts from advanced Braak stages of apolipoprotein E4 noncarriers. Our data show that ApoER2-CTF levels are decreased, whereas reelin expression is increased in AD brain at advanced Braak stages and after Aß treatment, supporting the view that ApoER2-CTF exerts a modulatory role on reelin expression.-Mata-Balaguer, T., Cuchillo-Ibañez, I., Calero, M., Ferrer, I., Sáez-Valero, J.

Patients with AD had significantly lower plasma levels of a-carotene, ß-carotene, lycopene, lutein, vitamin A, C, and E, and uric acid. No significant difference was observed for plasma levels of ß-cryptoxanthin and zeaxanthin. Considerable heterogeneity was detected across studies. The lower serum levels of dietary antioxidants from the carotene and vitamin subclasses observed in individuals with AD suggest [MASK] systemic availability of these subclasses in this prevalent form of dementia. To our knowledge, these are the first meta-analyses to demonstrate lower serum lycopene and to evaluate ß-cryptoxanthin, lutein, and  zeaxanthin levels in AD.

      "[CLS] The two cardinal pathologies of Alzheimers disease (AD) develop according to distinct anatomical trajectories. Cerebral tau-related pathology first accumulates in the mesial temporal region, while amyloid-related pathology first  appears in neocortex. The eventual distributions of these pathologies reflect their anatomical origins. An implication is that the cardinal pathologies might exert preferential effects on the [MASK] brain changes observed in AD. We investigated this hypothesis in 39 patients with dementia of the Alzheimers type. Interrelationships were analyzed between cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of the cardinal pathologies, volumetric brain changes using magnetic resonance imaging, and brain metabolism using [18F]-FDG-PET. Amyloid-related pathology was preferentially associated with [MASK] changes in the precuneus and lateral temporal regions. Tau-related pathology was not associated  with changes in these regions. These findings support the hypothesis that tau- and amyloid-pathology exert differential effects on [MASK] changes in the AD brain.

DESIGN: A qualitative study using in-depth semi-structured dyadic and individual  interviews with people living with a diagnosis of PCA and a family carer. Interview transcripts were thematically analysed. [MASK] Participants homes. PARTICIPANTS: 20 individuals in the mild to moderate stages of PCA and 20 family  carers. FINDINGS: Three major themes were identified: (1) the diagnostic journey: mostly  an unsettling and convoluted process, owing to the early age of onset, rarity and atypical symptom profile of PCA. (2) Interactions with the physical environment:  profound difficulties with functional and leisure activities were usually compensated for with adaptations maximising familiarity or simplicity. (3) Implications within the psychosocial environment: symptoms impacted individuals  sense of independence and identity and required reallocations of roles and responsibilities. Ongoing uncertainties and the progressive nature of PCA caused  most dyads to take a one?day at a time approach to coping. Relatively well-preserved insight and memory were a benefit and burden, as individuals shared the illness experience with family members and also compared their current situation to pre-diagnosis. The experience was framed by background and contextual factors and understood within an ever-changing temporal context. CONCLUSION: The stress process in PCA is characterised by uncertainty and unpredictability from diagnosis through to ongoing management. The provision of tailored information about cortical visual problems and associated functional difficulties, time-sensitive environmental adaptations to help those with PCA to  identify what and where things are and psychosocial interventions for the marital/family unit as a whole would be useful to improve both functional status  and psychological well-being. Future research exploring (1) stress and coping in  the later stages of PCA and (2) the nature and impact of visual impairment(s) in  typical Alzheimers disease would be worthwhile.

      "[CLS] OBJECTIVE: To describe the phenomenon of [MASK]-negative amnestic dementia mimicking Alzheimer disease (AD) clinically and radiologically and to highlight the importance of biomarkers in AD research. METHODS: Eight participants with amnestic mild cognitive impairment or AD dementia were evaluated by a behavioral neurologist and had a standardized neuropsychological battery performed. All participants completed structural (MRI) and molecular (amyloid and [MASK] PET) imaging. AD-signature thickness and adjusted  hippocampal volume served as structural biomarkers, while standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) from validated regions of interest for amyloid and [MASK] PET were used to determine molecular biomarker status. RESULTS: All participants were thought to have AD as the primary driver of their  symptoms before any PET imaging. All participants had hippocampal atrophy, and 2  participants fell below the AD-signature thickness cutoff for elderly controls (2.57), with a further 3 falling below the more stringent cutoff based on young controls (2.67). Four participants were amyloid positive (SUVR >1.42), and all were [MASK] negative (SUVR <1.33). CONCLUSIONS: The participants presented here were clinically impaired, with structural imaging evidence of neurodegeneration, in the absence of any significant [MASK] accumulation.

Free iron is incorporated into aggregating amyloid peptides during Aß plaque formation and increases potential for oxidative stress surrounding plaques. The goal [MASK] this work was to observe how brain iron levels temporally influence Aß plaque formation, plaque iron concentration, and microgliosis.

      "[CLS] INTRODUCTION: Degenerative diseases, such as Alzheimers disease, heart disease and arthritis cause great suffering and are major socioeconomic burdens. An attractive treatment approach is stem cell transplantation to regenerate damaged  or destroyed tissues. However, this can be problematic. For example, donor cells  may not functionally integrate into the host tissue. An alternative methodology is to deliver bioactive agents, such as small molecules, directly into the diseased tissue to enhance the regenerative potential [MASK] endogenous stem cells. Areas covered: In this review, the authors discuss the necessity [MASK] developing these small molecules to treat degenerative diseases and survey progress in their application as therapeutics. They describe both the successes and caveats [MASK] developing small molecules that target endogenous stem cells to induce tissue regeneration. This article is based on literature searches which encompass databases for biomedical research and clinical trials. These small molecules are  also categorized per their target disease and mechanism [MASK] action. Expert opinion: The development [MASK] small molecules targeting endogenous stem cells is a  high-pr[MASK]ile research area. Some compounds have made the successful transition to the clinic. Novel approaches, such as modulating the stem cell niche or targeted  delivery to disease sites, should increase the likelihood [MASK] future successes in  this field. [SEP]\t\tof\n",

      "[CLS] INTRODUCTION: Today, over 20 million people suffer from Alzheimers disease (AD)  worldwide. AD has become a critical issue to human health, especially in aging societies, and therefore it is a research hotspot in the global scientific community. [MASK] technology flow method differs from traditional reviews generating an informative overview of the research and development (R&D) landscape in a specific technological area. We need such an updated method to get a general overview of the R&D of anti-AD drugs in light of the dramatic developments in this area in recent years. AREAS COVERED: This study collects patent data from the Integrity database. A total of 399 patents with 821 internal citation pairs in the US from 1978 to 2017 were analyzed. Patent citation network analysis was used to visualize the technology relationship. EXPERT OPINION: For better production of anti-AD drugs, governments should emphasize the multi-target drug design, provide policy support for private companies, and encourage multilateral cooperation. [MASK] ß-amyloid peptide (Aß) theory leaves much to be desired; neurotransmitter and tau protein hypotheses are worth further examination.

      "[CLS] A novel series of quinoline-indole derivatives were synthesized and evaluated as  multitarget-directed ligands for the treatment of Alzheimers disease (AD). Biological evaluation revealed that the derivatives had multifunctional profiles  including antioxidant effects, blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration, biometal chelation, Aß aggregation modulation, neurotrophic and neuroprotective properties. Moreover, several representative target derivatives demonstrated hippocampal cell proliferation in living adult mice by intracerebroventricular (icv) injection or oral administration. Further drug-like property analysis demonstrated that the optimized compound, 8d (WI-1758), had liver microsomal metabolic stability, was well tolerated (>2000 mg/kg), and had a rational pharmacokinetic profile, as well as an oral bioavailability of 14.1% and a positive log BB (-0.19) to cross the BBB in vivo. Pharmacodynamics studies demonstrated that chronic oral administration of 8d·HCl substantially ameliorated the cognitive and spatial memory deficits in [MASK] AD mice and noticeably reduced overall cerebral ß-amyloid deposits.

The aim of this study was to investigate [MASK]  sensitivity of [MASK] CDT in monitoring and differentiating [MASK] evolution of cognitive decline in Alzheimers dementia (AD), vascular dementia (VaD), and Parkinsons disease (PD). METHODS: This study involved 139 patients, including 39 patients with PD and mild cognitive impairment, 16 demented PD patients, 21 VaD patients with mild cognitive impairment, 17 patients with VaD, 33 patients with mild cognitive impairment due to AD, and 13 patients with probable AD. All participants completed [MASK] CDT. The Mini-Mental State Examination was administered to establish patients cognitive functioning. RESULTS: Comparisons of quantitative and qualitative CDT scores showed significant differences between [MASK] various diseases. Impairment of executive functioning seems to be more pronounced in PD and VaD than in AD. Patients with AD committed more errors related to a loss of semantic knowledge, indicating a severely reduced capacity in abstract and conceptual thinking. CONCLUSION: Results support [MASK] usefulness and sensitivity of [MASK] CDT in [MASK] detection of different dementia subtypes. Qualitative error analysis of [MASK] CDT may be helpful in differentiating PD, VaD, and AD, even in [MASK] early stages of each disease. [SEP]\t\tthe\n",

      "[CLS] Aggregation of amyloid-ß (Aß) peptides in brain tissue leads to neurodegeneration in Alzheimers disease (AD). Regardless of the kinetics or detailed mechanisms of Aß aggregation, aggregation can only occur if Aß concentrations exceed their local equilibrium solubility values. We propose that excess Aß peptides can be removed from supersaturated solutions, including solutions in biological fluids,  by the addition of hydrogels that are seeded [MASK] Aß fibril fragments. Fibril growth [MASK]in the hydrogels then sequesters excess peptides until equilibrium concentrations are reached. Experiments [MASK] 40- and 42-residue Aß peptides (Aß40 and Aß42) in phosphate buffer at 24°C and in filtered fetal bovine serum at 37°C, using crosslinked polyacrylamide hydrogels, demonstrate the validity of this concept.

      "[CLS] Kainic acid (KA) exposure causes neuronal degeneration featured by Alzheimer-like tau hyperphosphorylation and memory deficits. Melatonin (Mel) is known to protect hippocampal neurons against KA-induced damage. However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. In the current study, we investigated the protective effect of melatonin on KA-induced tau hyperphosphorylation by focusing on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated signaling pathways. By using primary hippocampal neurons and mouse brain, we showed that KA treatment specifically induced ER stress and activated GSK-3ß and CDK5, two major kinases responsible for tau phosphorylation. Inhibition of ER stress efficiently inactivated GSK-3ß and CDK5. Mechanistically, we found that KA-induced ER stress significantly activated calpain, a calcium-dependent protease. Inhibition of ER stress or calpain leads to the reduction in KA-induced GSK-3ß and CDK5 activities and tau phosphorylation. Moreover, GSK-3ß or CDK5 inhibition failed to downregulate ER stress efficiently, suggesting that ER stress functions upstream of GSK-3ß or CDK5. Notably, our results revealed that melatonin acts against KA-induced neuronal degeneration and tau hyperphosphorylation via easing ER stress, [MASK]  highlighting the protective role of melatonin in the KA-induced neuronal defects.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: CAIDE Dementia Risk Score is a tool for estimating dementia risk in the general population. Its longitudinal associations with Alzheimer or vascular  neuropathology in the oldest old are not known. AIM: To explore the relationship between CAIDE Dementia Risk Score at baseline and neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, cerebral infarcts and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) after up to 10-year follow-up in the Vantaa 85 +  population. METHODS: Study population included 149 participants [MASK] =85 years, without dementia at baseline, and with available clinical and autopsy data. Methenamine silver staining was used for ß-amyloid and modified Bielschowsky method for neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques. Macroscopic infarcts were identified from cerebral hemispheres, brainstem and cerebellum slices. Standardized methods were used to determine microscopic infarcts, CAA and a-synuclein pathologies. The CAIDE Dementia Risk Score was calculated based on scores for age, sex, BMI, total cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, physical activity and APOEe4 carrier status (range 0-18 points). RESULTS: A CAIDE Dementia Risk Score above 11 points was associated with more cerebral infarctions up to 10 years later: OR (95% CI) was 2.10 (1.06-4.16). No associations were found with other neuropathologies. CONCLUSION: In a population of elderly [MASK] =85 years, higher CAIDE Dementia Risk Score was associated with increased risk of cerebral infarcts. [SEP]\t\taged\n",

      "[CLS] Alzheimers disease (AD) is a progressive degenerative neurological disorder affecting nearly one in nine elderly people in the United States. Population studies have shown that an inheritance of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) variant APOE4 allele increases the risk of developing AD, whereas APOE2 homozygotes are protected from late-onset AD. It [MASK] hypothesized that expression of the \"protective\" APOE2 variant by genetic modification of the central nervous system  (CNS) of APOE4 homozygotes could reverse or prevent progressive neurologic damage. To assess the CNS distribution and safety of APOE2 gene therapy for AD in a large-animal model, intraparenchymal, intracisternal, and intraventricular routes of delivery to the CNS of nonhuman primates of AAVrh.10hAPOE2-HA, an AAVrh.10 serotype coding for an HA-tagged human APOE2 cDNA sequence, were evaluated. To evaluate the route of delivery that achieves the widest extent of APOE2 expression in the CNS, the expression of APOE2 in the CNS [MASK] evaluated 2 months following vector administration for APOE2 DNA, mRNA, and protein. Finally, using conventional toxicology assays, the safety of the best route of delivery [MASK] assessed. The data demonstrated that while all three routes are capable of mediating ApoE2 expression in AD relevant regions, intracisternal delivery of AAVrh.10hAPOE2-HA safely mediated wide distribution of ApoE2 with the least invasive surgical intervention, thus providing the optimal strategy to deliver vector-mediated human APOE2 to the CNS.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: A simple, quick, and efficient screening tool for detecting mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimers disease (AD) is essential, especially  in the primary care setting. In this study, we examined the neuropsychological profiles of elderly patients and aimed to assess the diagnostic value of the triple test, comprised of the attended alone sign (AAS), head-turning sign, and applause sign (AS), for detecting MCI and AD. METHOD: Comprehensive geriatric assessment [MASK] performed in 354 elderly outpatients, and the presence or absence of AS, AAS and HTS [MASK] investigated. RESULTS: Of the 354 patients, 93 patients were considered to be cognitively impaired (MCI: 30; AD: 63); the remaining 261 were cognitively healthy. Relative  to those without AS, patients with AS had significantly lower scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination, the clock-drawing test, Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale, and Basic Activities of Daily Living Scale (P?<?0.001, for each). Similar significant differences were found between patients who were positive and negative for the HTS (P?<?0.001) and between those who attended the  clinic alone and those who were accompanied (P?<?0.001). The sensitivity of the triple test for identifying cognitively impairment (CI), MCI, and AD [MASK] 0.61, 0.30, and 0.72, respectively; the specificity [MASK] 0.85, 0.68, and 0.83, respectively; and the positive and negative predictive values were 0.69, 0.09, and 0.59, respectively, and 0.79, 0.90, and 0.89, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that the triple test is a simple, quick,  and efficient screening tool for detecting cognitive impairment, and the results  may reflect deterioration in patients activities of daily living. Additionally,  it could be advantageous in clinical practice because educational level does not  affect the test outcome. Therefore, it may be an appropriate test to screen for cognitive impairment in the elderly, both as a bedside diagnostic test and in daily clinical practice, especially in the primary care setting.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Unlike other behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia, hyperphagia is less recognized among patients with Alzheimers disease (AD). The  prevalence of hyperphagia varies among studies, but there has been no systematic  review or meta-analysis. METHODS: An extensive search on the literature on hyperphagia in AD published between 1?January 1980 and 30 October 2017 was conducted. Data on the prevalence  were retrieved. Meta-analysis with a random effect model was performed to determine the pooled estimate of prevalence. Meta-regression analysis was performed based on study characteristics, population demographics, or condition information. RESULTS: Results from 20 studies were extracted. Twenty-six reported cases of hyperphagia were identified. The mean age of onset was 70.7?±?8.9?years, with a male predominance (68.4%). Hyperphagia occurred in all stages of AD. Only eight studies reported the prevalence of hyperphagia. Meta-analysis showed a pooled prevalence of hyperphagia of 18.6%. Publication bias may have been present. Meta-regression showed that ethnicity accounted for the variance among studies (coefficient: -1.247 (95% confidence interval: -1.978 to -0.516), [MASK] analogue: 0.77, P?<?0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Hyperphagia occurs in all stages of AD. In this meta-analysis of eight published studies, the prevalence of hyperphagia was 18.6%.

      "[CLS] AIMS: Glutamate neurotoxicity plays an important role in the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative disorders. Many studies have demonstrated that glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1), the dominant astrocytic glutamate transporter, is significantly reduced in the cerebral cortex of patients with Alzheimers disease (AD), suggesting that glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity might contribute  to the pathogenesis of AD. In a previous study, we have demonstrated marked alterations in the expression of the astrocytic water channel protein aquaporin-4 (AQP4) in relation to amyloid ß deposition in human AD brains. As a functional complex, GLT-1 and AQP4 in astrocytes may play a neuroprotective role in the progression of AD pathology. However, few studies have examined the correlation between the expression of GLT-1 and that of AQP4 in human AD brain. METHODS: Here, using immunohistochemistry with antibodies against GLT-1 and AQP4, we studied the expression levels and distribution patterns of GLT-1 in areas showing various patterns of AQP4 expression in autopsied temporal lobes from eight patients with AD and five controls without neurological disorders. RESULTS: GLT-1 staining in the control group was present throughout the neocortex as uniform neuropil staining with co-localized AQP4. The AD group showed a significant reduction in GLT-1 expression, whereas cortical AQP4 immunoreactivity was more intense in the AD group than in the control group. There [MASK] two different patterns of GLT-1 and AQP4 expression in the AD group: (i) uneven GLT-1 expression in the neuropil where diffuse but intense AQP4 expression was evident, and (ii) senile plaque-like co-expression of GLT-1 and AQP4.

This dominantly inherited neurologic disease has reduced penetrance and no other medical manifestations. It has been challenging to understand the neuronal abnormalities as cells and mouse models which are heterozygous (Het) for the mutant allele are quite similar to wild-type (WT) controls. Here we found that patient fibroblasts and mouse neurons Het for this mutation showed significant differences from WT cells in several parameters  revealed by infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV) which replicates in  the nucleus and egresses out through the nuclear envelope. Using a red fluorescent protein capsid to monitor HSV infection, patient fibroblasts showed decreased viral plaque formation as compared to controls. Mouse Het neurons had a decrease in cytoplasmic, but not nuclear HSV fluorescence, and reduced numbers of capsids entering axons as compared to infected WT neurons. These findings point to altered dynamics of the nuclear envelope in cells with the patient genotype, which can provide assays to screen for therapeutic agents that can normalize these cells.

      "[CLS] The mitochondrial translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) is a protein complex that is essential for the post-translational import of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins. Among its subunits, TOM70 and TOM20 are only transiently  associated with the core complex, suggesting their possible additional roles within the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM). Here, by using different mammalian cell lines, we demonstrate that TOM70, but not TOM20, clusters in distinct OMM foci, frequently overlapping with sites in which the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) contacts mitochondria. Functionally, TOM70 depletion specifically impairs inositol trisphosphates (IP3)-linked ER to mitochondria Ca2+ transfer. This phenomenon is dependent on the capacity of TOM70 to interact with IP3-receptors and favor their functional recruitment close to mitochondria. [MASK] the reduced constitutive Ca2+ transfer to mitochondria, observed in TOM70-depleted cells, dampens mitochondrial respiration, affects cell bioenergetics, induces autophagy, and inhibits proliferation. Our data reveal a hitherto unexpected role for TOM70 in pro-survival ER-mitochondria communication, reinforcing the view that the ER-mitochondria signaling platform is a key regulator of cell fate.

      "[CLS] INTRODUCTION: Walking while talking (WWT) is a performance-based test of divided  attention that examines cognitive-motor interactions. The purpose of this study is to examine the predictive validity of WWT for dementia and dementia subtypes. METHODS: We prospectively studied the associations of WWT performance at baseline with risk of developing incident dementia in 1,156 older adults (mean age: 78.28?±?5.27 years, 60.7% female) enrolled in the Einstein Aging Study using Cox  proportional hazard models. Associations were reported as hazard ratio (HR) with  95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 1.90 years (interquartile range: 4.70 years), 85 participants developed incident dementia (53 Alzheimer dementia [AD] and 26 vascular dementia [VaD]). Three gait domains were derived using principal component analysis. Only variability, which loaded heavily for swing time standard deviation (SD) and step time SD, was associated with an increased risk of incident dementia per 1 point increase (HR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.02-1.54) and VaD (HR: 1.50, 95% CI: 1.06-2.12) after adjusting for demographics, disease burden, mental [MASK] and normal walking velocity. Among eight individual gait variables, only swing time variability SD was associated with increased risk for  both incident dementia (HR: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.03-1.77) and VaD (HR: 1.78, 95% CI: 1.12-2.83). Variability and swing time SD were not significantly associated with  risk of incident AD. CONCLUSIONS: Complex walking as assessed by the WWT task is a simple and pragmatic tool for assessing risk of developing dementia, especially VaD, in older adults. [SEP]\t\tstatus,\n",

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Despite a tremendous amount of information on the role of amyloid in  Alzheimers disease (AD), almost all clinical trials testing this hypothesis have failed to generate clinically relevant cognitive effects. METHODS: We present an advanced mechanism-based and biophysically realistic quantitative systems pharmacology computer model of an Alzheimer-type neuronal cortical network that has been calibrated with Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale, cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) readouts from historical clinical trials and simulated the differential impact of amyloid-beta (Aß40 and Aß42) oligomers on glutamate and nicotinic neurotransmission. RESULTS: Preclinical data suggest a beneficial effect of shorter Aß forms within  a limited dose range. Such a beneficial effect of Aß40 on glutamate neurotransmission in human patients is [MASK] necessary to reproduce clinical data on the ADAS-Cog in minimal cognitive impairment (MCI) patients with and without amyloid load, the effect of APOE genotype effect on the slope of the cognitive trajectory over time in placebo AD patients and higher sensitivity to cholinergic manipulation with scopolamine associated with higher Aß in MCI subjects. We further derive a relationship between units of Aß load in our model  and the standard uptake value ratio from amyloid imaging. When introducing the documented clinical pharmacodynamic effects on Aß levels for various amyloid-related clinical interventions in patients with low Aß baseline, the platform predicts an overall significant worsening for passive vaccination with solanezumab, beta-secretase inhibitor verubecestat and gamma-secretase inhibitor  semagacestat. In contrast, all three interventions improved cognition in subjects with moderate to high baseline Aß levels, with verubecestat anticipated to have the greatest effect (around ADAS-Cog value 1.5 points), solanezumab the lowest (0.8 ADAS-Cog value points) and semagacestat in between. This could explain the success of many amyloid interventions in transgene animals with an artificial high level of Aß, but not in AD patients with a large variability of amyloid loads. CONCLUSIONS: If these predictions are confirmed in post-hoc analyses of failed clinical amyloid-modulating trials, one should question the rationale behind testing these interventions in early and prodromal subjects with low or zero amyloid load.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Due [MASK] common pathophysiological findings of Alzheimers disease (AD) with diabetes mellitus (DM), insulin has been suggested as a possible treatment of AD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). A safe alternative of IV insulin is intranasal (IN) insulin. The aim of this systematic review is [MASK] investigate the effects of IN insulin on cognitive function of patients with either AD or MCI. METHODS: A literature search of the electronic databases Medline, Scopus and CENTRAL was performed [MASK] identify RCTs investigating the effect of IN insulin administration on cognitive tasks, in patients with AD or MCI. RESULTS: Seven studies (293 patients) met our inclusion criteria. Most studies showed that verbal memory and especially s[MASK]ry recall was improved after IN insulin administration. Sometimes the effect was restricted for apoe4 (-) patients. Intranasal insulin did not affect other cognitive functions. However, there were some positive results in functional status and daily activity. Data suggested that different insulin types and doses may have different effects on different apoe4 groups. In addition, the effects of treatment on ?ß levels differed from study [MASK] study. Finally, IN insulin resulted in minor adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: Intranasal insulin improved s[MASK]ry recall performance of apoe4 (-) patients with AD or MCI. Other cognitive functions were not affected, but there were some positive results in functional status and daily activity. Since IN insulin is a safe intervention, future studies should be conducted with larger doses and after proper selection of patients and insulin types. [SEP]\t\tto\n",

      "[CLS] Background: Reading disorder (RD) is one of the important complaints in children  with learning disorders (LD) that is prevalent in 4% of children in the United States. Treating this disorder includes education of reading practices and treating psychological disorders, and there are no exact medications prescribed in these children. Memantine has been effective in treating memory problems in Alzheimer Dementia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism disorder, and other psychological diseases. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of memantine in improving RD in children. Materials and Methods: In this randomized clinical trial, 62 children, with RD in Pediatric Psychiatry Clinics of Noor and Ali-Asghar Hospital in Isfahan from 2015 to 2016, were participated. They were randomly assigned to two groups of equal number, one receiving education plus memantine and the other education plus placebo. RD was evaluated at the beginning, 1 and 3 months after intervention by  Iranian standard reading and dyslexia test (Nama). Results: Mean (standard deviation) age of participants was 7.55 (0.60) years. Most of the participants were boy (55%), most having parents in 36-45-year-old age group (52% and 48% for fathers and mothers, respectively), and also most parents in diploma and bachelor educational group (61% and 60% for fathers and mothers, respectively). There were statistical significant difference in trend of total score (P = [MASK] word chain (P < 0.001), rhyming (P < 0.001), text comprehension (P < 0.001), and letter fluency (P = 0.002), subscale between two groups. However, the difference of time trend between two groups was not significant in word reading (P = 0.14), word comprehension (P = 0.06), phoneme deletion (P = 0.12), reading nonwords (P = 0.32), and category fluency (P = 0.06). Conclusion: Adding memantine to educational practices is effective in improving RD in school-age children with LD. [SEP]\t\t0.034),\n",

At the end of the experiment, behavior of the mice was assessed. Serum [MASK] level, hippocampal protein level of the glucocorticoid receptors, and brain-derived neurotropic factor were also assessed. Hippocampus was histopathologically examined. RESULTS: Musk improved depressive status induced after exposure to CUMS as evidenced by the forced swimming and open field tests and improved the short-term memory as evidenced by the elevated plus maze test. Musk reduced both [MASK] levels and the hippocampal neurodegenerative changes observed after exposure to CUMS. These improvements were comparable to those induced by fluoxetine. CONCLUSION: Musk alleviated the memory impairment and neurodegenerative changes induced after exposure to the chronic stress. [SEP]\t\tcorticosterone\n",

      "[CLS] Excessive copper intake can lead to neurotoxicity, but there is a lack of comprehensive understanding on the potential impact of copper exposure especially at a low-dose on brain. We used 3xTg-AD mice to [MASK] the potential neurotoxicity of chronic, low-dose copper treatment (0.13 ppm copper chloride in  drinking water) on behavior and the brain hippocampal mitochondrial and nuclear proteome. Low-dose copper increased the spatial memory impairment of these animals, increased accumulation of intracellular amyloid 1-42 (Aß1-42), decreased ATP content, increased the positive staining of 8-hydroxyguanosine (8-OHdG), a marker of DNA oxidative damage, and caused apoptosis and a decrease in synaptic proteins. Mitochondrial proteomic analysis by two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) revealed modulation of 24 hippocampal mitochondrial proteins (14 increased and 10 decreased) in copper-treated vs. untreated 3xTg-AD mice. Nuclear proteomic analysis revealed 43 modulated hippocampal nuclear proteins (25 increased and 18 decreased) in copper-treated 3xTg-AD vs. untreated mice. Classification of modulated mitochondrial and nuclear proteins included functional categories such as energy metabolism, synaptic-related proteins, DNA damage and apoptosis-related proteins, and oxidative stress-related proteins. Among these differentially expressed mitochondrial and nuclear proteins, nine proteins were abnormally expressed in both hippocampus mitochondria and nuclei, including electron transport chain-related proteins NADH dehydrogenase 1 alpha subcomplex subunit 10 (NDUAA),  cytochrome b-c1 complex subunit Rieske (UCRI), cytochrome c oxidase subunit 5B (COX5B), and ATP synthase subunit d (ATP5H), glycolytic-related pyruvate kinase PKM (KPYM) and pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component subunit alpha (ODPA). Furthermore, we found coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), an endogenous mitochondrial protective factor/antioxidant, modulated the expression of 12 differentially expressed hippocampal proteins (4 increased and 8 decreased), which could be classified in functional categories such as glycolysis and synaptic-related proteins, oxidative stress-related proteins, implying that CoQ10 improved synaptic function, suppress oxidative stress, and regulate glycolysis. For the proteomics study, we validated the expression of several proteins related to synapses, DNA and apoptosis. The data confirmed that synapsin-2, a synaptic-related protein, was significantly decreased in both mitochondria and nuclei of copper-exposed 3xTg-AD mice. In mitochondria, dynamin-1 (DYN1), an apoptosis-related proteins, was significantly decreased. In the cellular nuclei,  paraspeckle protein 1 (PSPC1) and purin-rich element-binding protein alpha (Pura), two DNA damage-related proteins, were significantly decreased and increased, respectively. We conclude that low-dose copper exposure exacerbates the spatial memory impairment of 3xTg-AD mice and perturbs multiple biological/pathogenic processes by dysregulating the mitochondrial and nuclear proteome. Exposure to copper might therefore contribute to the evolution of AD. [SEP]\t\texplore\n",

      "[CLS] Sulforaphane was reported to exert neuroprotective effects via upregulating expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and has received increasing attention as an alternative candidate for treatment of Alzheimers disease (AD). However, the mechanism to account for Nrf2 upregulation by sulforaphane in AD remains unknown. Herein, we found that sulforaphane upregulated Nrf2 expression and promoted Nrf2 nuclear translocation via decreasing DNA methylation levels of the Nrf2 promoter in mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells stably expressing human Swedish mutant amyloid precursor protein (N2a/APPswe cells), a cellular model of AD. Furthermore, sulforaphane (1.25 and 2.5?µM) decreased the levels of amyloid ß 1-40 (Aß1-40) (21.7% and 33.4% decrease for intracellular Aß1-40; 22.0% and 30.2% decrease in culture medium), Aß1-42 (26.4% and 42.9% decrease for intracellular Aß1-42; 25.8% and [MASK] decrease in culture medium), reactive oxygen species (15.0% and 28.5% decrease), and malondialdehyde (MDA) (34.4% and 39.2% decrease) and increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) (60.0% and 89.3% increase) activity in N2a/APPswe cells. Sulforaphane also decreased the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin  1ß (IL-1ß) (16.5% and 33.6% decrease) and IL-6 (15.6% and 26.1% decrease) and reduced phosphorylated nuclear factor-?B (NF-?B) p65 (19.2% and 32.2% decrease),  cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) (20.5% and 28.6% decrease), and iNOS protein (40.2% and  54.7% decrease) expression levels in N2a/APPswe cells. Our study suggested that sulforaphane upregulated the expression of Nrf2 and promoted the nuclear translocation of Nrf2 by decreasing DNA demethylation levels of the Nrf2 promoter, thus leading to antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects in a cellular model of AD.

      "[CLS] Objective: To test the association of distinct neuropathologic features of Alzheimer disease (AD) with risk loci identified in genome-wide association studies. Methods: Vantaa 85+ is a population-based study that includes 601 participants aged =85 years, of which 256 were neuropathologically examined. We analyzed 29 AD risk loci in addition to APOE e4, which was studied separately and used as a covariate. Genotyping was performed using a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)  array (341 variants) and imputation (6,038 variants). Participants with Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer Disease (CERAD) (neuritic Aß plaques) scores 0 (n = 65) vs score M + F (n = 171) and Braak [MASK] tangle pathology) stages 0-II (n = 74) vs stages IV-VI (n = 119), and with capillary Aß (CapAß, n = 77) vs without (n = 179) were compared. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) percentage was analyzed as a continuous variable. Results: Altogether, 24 of the 29 loci were associated (at p < 0.05) with one or  more AD-related neuropathologic features in either SNP array or imputation data.  Fifteen loci associated with CERAD score, smallest p = 0.0002122, odds ratio (OR) 2.67 (1.58-4.49) at MEF2C locus. Fifteen loci associated with Braak stage, smallest p = 0.004372, OR 0.31 (0.14-0.69) at GAB2 locus. Twenty loci associated  with CAA, smallest p = 7.17E-07, ß 14.4 (8.88-20) at CR1 locus. Fifteen loci associated with CapAß smallest p = 0.002594, OR 0.54 (0.37-0.81) at HLA-DRB1 locus. Certain loci associated with specific neuropathologic features. CASS4, CLU, and ZCWPW1 associated only with CAA, while TREM2 and HLA-DRB5 associated only with CapAß. Conclusions: AD risk loci differ in their association with neuropathologic features, and we show for the first time distinct risk loci for CAA and CapAß. [SEP]\t\t(neurofibrillary\n",

      "[CLS] Brain activity levels are tightly regulated to minimize imbalances in activity state. Deviations from the normal range of activity are deleterious and often associated with neurological disorders. To maintain optimal levels of activity, regulatory mechanisms termed homeostatic synaptic plasticity [MASK] desired set points for neural activity, monitor the network for deviations from the set point and initiate compensatory responses to return activity to the appropriate level that permits physiological function [1,2]. We speculate that impaired homeostatic control may contribute to the etiology of various neurological disorders including epilepsy and Alzheimers disease, two disorders that exhibit  hyperexcitability as a key feature during pathogenesis. Here, we will focus on recent progress in developing homeostatic regulation of neural activity as a therapeutic tool. [SEP]\t\testablish\n",

      "[CLS] Earlier we reported induction of neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration by tryptophan metabolites that link the metabolic alterations to Alzheimers disease (AD). Tryptophan is a product of Shikimate pathway (SP). Human cells lack SP, which is found in human gut bacteria exclusively using SP to produce aromatic amino acids (AAA). This study is a first attempt toward gene-targeted analysis of human gut microbiota in AD fecal samples. The oligonucleotide primers newly-designed for this work target SP-AAA in environmental bacteria associated with human activity. Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we found unique gut bacterial sequence in most AD patients (18 of 20), albeit rarely in controls (1 of 13). Cloning and sequencing AD-associated PCR products (ADPP) enables identification of Na(+)-transporting NADH: Ubiquinone reductase (NQR) in Clostridium sp. The ADPP of unrelated AD patients possess near identical sequences. NQR substrate, ubiquinone is a SP product and human neuroprotectant. A deficit in ubiquinone has been determined in a number of neuromuscular and neurodegenerative disorders. Antibacterial therapy prompted an ADPP reduction in  an ADPP-positive control person who was later diagnosed with AD-dementia. We explored the gut microbiome databases and uncovered a sequence similarity [MASK] to  97%) between ADPP and some healthy individuals from different geographical locations. Importantly, our main finding of the significant difference in the gut microbial genotypes between the AD and control human populations is a breakthrough. [SEP]\t\t(up\n",

      "[CLS] Accumulating evidence suggests a diet high in protein and fiber may confer some protection against Alzheimers disease (AD). However, no human studies to-date have assessed the relationship between protein and fiber intake, and plasma and brain amyloid-ß (Aß). Consequently, this cross-sectional study, investigated the  association of self-reported dietary intakes of protein and fiber, with plasma and brain Aß burden (n?=?541, and n?=?162 respectively), in a well-characterized  cohort of cognitively normal older adults, drawn from the larger Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study of aging. We observed 12.59 and 8.43 higher odds of high brain Aß burden (PiB PET SUVR=1.5) if protein intake fell in the lowest and middle tertile, respectively, compared to the highest tertile (p?=?0.008; p?=?0.013). Thus, in this cohort, the more protein consumed,  the less likelihood of high Aß burden in the brain. No other significant associations were observed. The results of this study highlight the potentially protective impact of high dietary protein intake on brain Aß burden in older adults, before objective memory decline is apparent. While longitudinal validation is required, these [MASK] may assist in the development of dietary approaches aimed at preventing or delaying AD onset. [SEP]\t\tfindings\n",

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: An improved understanding of the role of neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in the course of Alzheimers disease (AD) has recently emerged. NPS lead to hospitalization and caregiver stress, but are more variable during the course of  the disease than other symptoms. Knowledge about the role of specific NPS in disease progression and prognosis is especially limited. OBJECTIVES: To examine the relationship between specific NPS and AD severity during a 5-year follow-up period, and to determine which baseline NPS predict AD  progression. METHODS: 236 persons with very mild (CDR 0.5) or mild (CDR 1) AD at baseline and  their caregivers were followed up for five years as part of the ALSOVA study. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory was used to assess NPS, and AD severity progression was measured with the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes. Data was analyzed with Generalized Estimated Equations and Linear Mixed Models. RESULTS: The baseline NPS that best predicted AD progression were [MASK] agitation, and aberrant motor behavior, while AD severity during follow-up was associated with hallucinations, [MASK] agitation, apathy, aberrant motor behavior, and sleep and appetite disturbances. CONCLUSIONS: Persons with mild AD presenting [MASK] agitation, and aberrant motor behavior at the time of diagnosis could have a more rapidly progressing disease, and some NPS are associated with AD severity. These results highlight the importance of evaluating NPS at the time of AD diagnosis, and the need to offer additional support to persons presenting [MASK] agitation and aberrant  motor behavior, and their caregivers.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Gray matter changes associated with the progression of Alzheimers disease (AD) have been thoroughly studied. However, alterations in white matter tracts have received less attention, particularly during early or preclinical stages of the disease. OBJECTIVE: To identify the structural connectivity changes across the AD continuum. METHODS: We performed probabilistic tractography in a total of 183 subjects on two independent samples that include control (n?=?68) and preclinical AD individuals (n?=?28), patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD (n?=?44), and AD patients (n?=?43). We compared the connectivity between groups, and with CSF Aß42 and tau biomarkers. RESULTS: We observed disconnections in preclinical individuals, mainly located in the temporal lobe. This pattern of disconnection spread to the parietal and frontal lobes at the MCI stage and involved almost all the brain in AD. These findings were not [MASK] by gray matter atrophy. DISCUSSION: Using tractography, we were able to identify white matter changes between subsequent disease stages and, notably, also in preclinical AD. Therefore, this method may be useful for detecting early and specific brain structural changes during preclinical AD stage. [SEP]\t\tdriven\n",

METHODS: Biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of liposomes in young or aged healthy mice and in an Alzheimers mouse model were measured by radiochemical techniques. The expression of brain receptors and structural proteins was evaluated by Western blot. RESULTS: At equal blood levels, the amount and integrity of liposomes in the brain were dramatically lower in Alzheimers or aged mice, with respect to young  animals. These d[MASK]ferences are likely attributable to molecular alterations in the brain vasculature.

      "[CLS] Abnormal DNA methylation patterns have been demonstrated to be associated with the pathogenesis of Alzheimers disease (AD). The present study aimed to identify differential methylation in the superior [MASK] gyrus (STG) of patients with late-onset AD based on epigenome-wide DNA methylation data by bioinformatics analysis. The genome-wide DNA methylation data in the STG region of 34 patients with late-onset AD and 34 controls without dementia were recruited from the Gene  Expression Omnibus database. Through systemic quality control, differentially methylated CpG sites were determined by the Students t-test and mean methylation value differences between the two conditions. Hierarchical clustering analysis was applied to assess the classification performance of differentially methylated CpGs. Functional analysis was performed to investigate the biological functions of the genes associated with differentially methylated CpGs. A total of 17,895 differentially methylated CpG sites were initially identified, including 11,822 hypermethylated CpGs and 6,073 hypomethylated CpGs. Further analysis examined 2,211 differentially methylated CpGs (covering 1,991 genes). AD subjects demonstrated distinctive DNA methylation patterns when compared with the controls, with a classification accuracy value of 1. Hypermethylation was mainly  detected for genes regulating the cell cycle progression, whereas hypomethylation was observed in genes involved in transcription factor binding. The present study demonstrated widespread and distinctive DNA methylation alterations in late-onset AD.

      "[CLS] OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between white matter hyperintensities (WMH) presumed to indicate disease of the cerebral small vessels, temporal lobe atrophy, and verbal memory deficits in Alzheimer disease (AD) and other dementias. METHODS: We recruited groups of participants with and without AD, including strata with extensive WMH and minimal WMH, into a cross-sectional proof-of-principle study (n = 118). A consecutive case series from a memory clinic was used as an independent validation sample (n = 702; Sunnybrook Dementia Study; NCT01800214). We assessed WMH volume and left temporal lobe atrophy (measured as the brain parenchymal fraction) using structural MRI and verbal memory using the California Verbal Learning Test. Using path modeling with an inferential bootstrapping procedure, we tested an indirect effect of WMH on verbal recall that depends sequentially on temporal lobe atrophy and verbal learning. RESULTS: In both samples, WMH predicted poorer verbal recall, specifically due to temporal lobe atrophy and poorer verbal learning (proof-of-principle -1.53, 95% bootstrap confidence interval [CI] -2.45 to -0.88; and confirmation -0.66, 95% CI [-0.95 to -0.41] words). This pathway was [MASK]ificant in subgroups with (-0.20, 95% CI [-0.38 to -0.07] words, n = 363) and without (-0.71, 95% CI [-1.12 to -0.37] words, n = 339) AD. Via the identical pathway, WMH contributed to deficits in recognition memory (-1.82%, 95% CI [-2.64% to -1.11%]), a sensitive and specific [MASK] of AD. CONCLUSIONS: Across dementia syndromes, WMH contribute indirectly to verbal memory deficits considered pathognomonic of Alzheimer disease, specifically by contributing to temporal lobe atrophy.

A comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests was administrated to assess their cognitive function. Linear stepwise discriminant analysis was used to identify the neuropsychological measures with values that could differentiate between [MASK] DLB and [MASK] AD .

[MASK] this family, the loss-of-function mutation IVS1?+?5G?>?C was identified in 2006.  [MASK] 2007, a clinical description of the mutation carriers was published that revealed the clinical heterogeneity among IVS1?+?5G?>?C carriers. We report our comparison of our data with the published clinical and neuropathological characteristics of other GRN mutations as well as other frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) syndromes, and we present a review of the literature. METHODS: For each case, standardized sampling and staining were performed to identify proteinopathies, cerebrovascular disease, and hippocampal sclerosis. RESULTS: The neuropathological substrate in the studied family was compatible in  all cases with transactive response DNA-binding protein (TDP) proteinopathy type  A, as expected. Additionally, most of the cases presented also with primary age-related tauopathy (PART) or mild Alzheimers disease (AD) neuropathological changes, and one case had extensive Lewy body pathology. An additional finding was the presence of cerebral small vessel changes in every patient in this family. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show not only that the IVS1?+?5G?>?C mutation has an exclusive association with FTLD-TDP type A proteinopathy but also that other proteinopathies can occur and should be looked for. Because the penetrance rate of the clinical phenotype of carriers of GRN mutations is age-dependent, further  research is required to investigate the role of co-occurring age-related pathologies such as AD, PART, and cerebral small vessel disease.

We have reported for the first time that brain IDO activation is related to Aß1-42 exposure in young mice. Because aging is characterized by a brain dyshomeostasis and because it remains the most dominant risk factor for AD, the purpose of this study was to determine whether aging is associated with a higher sensitivity to behavioural and neurochemical alterations elicited by an intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of Aß1-42 (400?pmol/mice), and whether KYN pathway is involved in these effects. We confirmed that aged mice displayed higher cognitive deficit in the object recognition test and higher anxiety-like behaviour in the elevated plus-maze and open field tests after the Aß1-42 administration. Aged mice also responded to Aß1-42 with a higher deficiency of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, glutathione levels and total radical-trapping  antioxidant capacity, a higher IDO activity, and a higher KYN and KYN/tryptophan  ratio in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. These effects of Aß1-42 were associated with a higher proinflammatory status, as measured by higher levels of  interleukin-6, lower levels of interleukin-10 and higher expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and allograft inflammatory factor 1 (Iba1) in the brain of aged mice.

      "[CLS] Research on autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and on Alzheimers Disease (AD) and other types of dementia describes a behaviour called wandering, a term that denotes movement through space lacking intention or exact destination, as when a  person is disoriented or not self-aware. In the U.S., wandering in both ASD and AD has been examined mostly from a management and prevention perspective. It prioritizes safety while primarily overlooking personal experiences of those who  wander and their families, thus limiting the range of potentially effective strategies to address this issue. Communicative challenges faced by many people diagnosed with ASD and AD further obscure the experiential, existential aspects of wandering. This article reflects an increasing concern of social science scholars interested in whether and how the conceptual and practical strategies to address wandering are informed by the situated experiences of people with cognitive and developmental disabilities and their families. We examine wandering at the intersections of personal experience, family life, clinical practice, public health policy, and legislation, as a conceptually rich site where notions of personhood, subjectivity, intentionality, and quality of life powerfully and consequentially converge to impact the lives of many people with ASD and AD, and their families. We draw upon critical autism studies describing how attributions of personhood, subjectivity, intentionality, rational agency, and moral autonomy of people with ASD have been contingent upon the norms and conventions governing movement of the human body through space (Hilton, Afr Am Rev 50(2):221-235, 2017). When this movement is deemed aberrant, the person may be construed as irrational, a danger to self because of a lack of self-awareness, and a danger to others because of a lack of empathy. These attributions put the person at risk of being excluded from the considerations and, more importantly, the obligations of the moral community to ensure that he or she has a good human life (Barnbaum, The Ethics of Autism: Among Them but not of Them. Indiana  University Press, Bloomington, 2008; Silvers and Francis, Metaphilosophy 40(3/4):475-498, 2009). Using ethnographic, narrative phenomenological (Mattingly, The Paradox of Hope: Journeys through a Clinical Borderland.

We argue for an extension of the prevention and management view to focus not only on safety but also on what phenomenologist Merleau-Ponty (1962) called \"having a world\" (p. 146). The analysis is intended to inform clinical practice, policy and public health efforts to enhance understanding of first and second person perspectives on wandering in order to improve the participation and quality of life of people with ASD and AD who wander, and their families.

      "[CLS] Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia characterized by the formation of amyloid plaques (Aß). Over the last decade, the important role of the innate immune system for the disease development has been established. Chronic activation of microglial cells creates a proinflammatory environment, which is believed to be central for the development of the disease as well as its progression. We used the AD mouse model 5xFAD to investigate if inflammatory alterations are present in microglial cells before plaque deposition. We applied  mass spectrometry and bioinformation analysis to elucidate early microglial alterations. Interestingly, we found the cytokines IL1ß and IL10 to be elevated in the 5xFAD brain after the formation of Aß plaque at 10 weeks only. Using mass  spectrometry analysis of microglial cells with bioinformation analysis, we found  JAK/STAT, p38 MAPK and Interleukin pathways affected in microglial cells before plaque deposition at 6 weeks. At 10 weeks, GO analysis showed affected pathways related to interferon-gamma regulation and MAPK pathways.

Herein, we aimed to investigate the effect of thymoquinone (TQ), an anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and neuroprotective agent, on STZ-induced neurodegeneration in rats. For this purpose, bilateral i.c.v. injection of STZ (3?mg/kg) was given to  adult female rats on days 1 and 3. TQ (20?mg/kg/day in cornoil) was administered  intragastrically to rats for 15 days starting from the 15th day of STZ injection. The Morris water maze test and passive avoidance test were applied to measure the learning and memory performance of animals. Following the behavioral tests, all of the rats were sacrificed for evaluation of [MASK] alterations. Rats in the  STZ-TQ group showed higher performance in passive avoidance test than rats in the STZ group whose memory performance declined compared to control group. The worse  memory performance in STZ group was correlated with low number of surviving neurons and high number of degenerating neurons. In addition, an increase in APOE expression and a decrease in NGF expression were observed with STZ injection. Administration of TQ reversed these STZ-triggered cognitive and [MASK] alterations. In the present study, we observed the neuroregenerative effects of TQ by activation of JNK protein, upregulation of mir-124, and downregulation of ERK1/2 and NOS enzymes. The same ameliorative effect of TQ was also observed in the pTau protein expression. To sum up, we can say that the healing effect of TQ  on STZ induced neurodegeneration opens a new door for the development of Alzheimers disease treatment using natural products as an adjuvant when their action mechanism was explained in detail.

These IDPs are extremely flexible and do not adopt stable structures.

Classical molecular dynamics simulations complement experiments  and provide structural information at the atomic level with dynamics without facing the same experimental limitations. Artificial missense mutations are employed experimentally and computationally for providing insights into the structure-function relationships of amyloid-ß and a-synuclein in relation to the  pathologies of Alzheimers and Parkinsons diseases.

AD-related inflammatory responses, matrix remodeling and the responses to DAPT, heparin (completes with heparan sulfate proteoglycans [HSPGs]  to bind Aß42), and heparinase (digests HSPGs) treatments were investigated. The results indicate that the cortical organoids derived from AD-associated hiPSCs exhibit a high level of Aß42 comparing with healthy control.

We also examined the ability of bromelain to interfere in vitro with synthetic Aß42 aggregates in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of Alzheimers disease as well as of control patients affected by other neurological diseases.

Tools such as electroencephalography (EEG) offer additional measures of [MASK] processing, indexing the electrophysiological changes associated with aging, MCI and AD. OBJECTIVE: We reviewed the literature on EEG to determine if auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) could distinguish between healthy aging, MCI, and AD. METHOD: We searched two electronic databases (Medline and PyscInfo) for articles  published between January 2005 and April 2017. Articles were considered for review if they included: i) participants 60 years of age or older; ii) healthy older adults or those diagnosed with MCI or AD; iii) at least one auditory elicited ERP component.

Correct answer score improved MMSE predictive power from 0.547 to 0.560 (Cox & Snell R2,  p = 0.012), and Affect-GRADIOR speed of processing score improved MMSE predictive power from 0.547 to 0.563 (Cox & Snell R2, p = 0.010).

      "[CLS] INTRODUCTION: Asset based approaches to dementia research and measurement emphasise the need to also assess the strengths and capabilities that people with dementia retain, rather than assessing only losses or deficits. The CASP-19 proposes wellbeing as the satisfaction of four needs (control, autonomy, self-realisation and pleasure). The CASP-19 may reflect the asses-based approach  and has been validated in over 20 countries. The aim of this study was to evaluate the CASP-19s psychometric properties in older adults with dementia. METHODS: An observational study was conducted at five NHS trusts across England.  Participants were asked to [MASK] complete the CASP-19 by interview or self-report, alongside four other measures to assess psychometric properties. RESULTS: Internal consistency overall was good (a = .856) but the autonomy subscale fell below the acceptable. The CASP-19 was significantly correlated in the expected direction with measures of quality of life (r = .707), depression (r = -.707) and additional measures. It also remained moderately stable over a one-week period but factor analyses indicated a 12-item measure may be more robust. CONCLUSIONS: Despite some variations, the CASP-19 appears to have adequate psychometric properties for older adults with dementia and can be used in future  research and practice. [SEP]\t\teither\n",

      "[CLS] Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia and has an increasing incidence. The neuropathogenesis of AD is suggested to be a result of  the accumulation of amyloid-ß (Aß) peptides in the brain. To date, Aß-induced cognitive and neurophysiologic impairments have not been illuminated sufficiently. Therefore, we aimed to examine how spontaneous brain activities of  rats changed by injection of increasing Aß doses into the brain hemispheres, and  whether these changes could be used as a new biomarker for the early diagnosis of the AD. Rats were randomized into following groups: sham (Sham) and seven Aß-treated (i.c.v.) groups in increasing concentrations (from Aß-1 to Aß-7). After recovery, EEG recordings were obtained from implanted electrodes from eight electrode locations, and then, spectral and statistical analyses were performed.  A significant decrement in gamma activity was observed in all Aß groups compared  with the sham group. In delta activity, we observed significant changes from Aß-4 to Aß-7 group compared with sham group. Delta coherence values were decreased from Aß-4 to Aß-7 and Aß-5 to Aß-7 groups for frontal and temporal electrode pairs, respectively. A gradual increment was observed in Aß1-42 level till Aß-4 group. Positive correlation for [MASK] delta power and negative correlation for [MASK] gamma power between Aß1-42 peptide levels were detected. Consequently, it  is conceivable to suggest gamma oscillation might be used to detect early stages  of AD.

In this study, we aimed to determine the underlying mechanisms of this regulation under pathological conditions. We establish that melatonin prevents Aß42 -induced downregulation of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 10 (ADAM10) as well as upregulation of ß-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and presenilin 1 (PS1) in SH-SY5Y cell cultures. We also demonstrate that the intrinsic mechanisms of the observed effects occurred via regulation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells  (NF-?B) and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3ß as melatonin reversed Aß42 -induced upregulation and nuclear translocation of NF-?Bp65 as well as activation of GSK3ß via its receptor activation. Furthermore, specific blocking of the NF-?B and GSK3ß pathways partially abrogated the Aß42 -induced reduction in the BACE1 and PS1 levels. In addition, GSK3ß blockage affected a-secretase cleavage and modulated nuclear translocation of NF-?B. Importantly, our study for the first time shows that peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase NIMA-interacting 1 (Pin1) is  a crucial target of melatonin. The compromised levels and/or genetic variation of Pin1 are associated with age-dependent tau and Aß pathologies and neuronal [MASK] Interestingly, melatonin alleviated the Aß42 -induced reduction of  nuclear Pin1 levels and preserved the functional integrity of this isomerase.

In this study, we examined the preventive effect of the total prenylflavonoids (TPFB) prepared from the dried fruits of Psoralea corylifolia L., using an age-related AD mouse model SAMP8. We found that long-term dietary TPFB at 50 mg/kg·day significantly improved cognitive performance of the SAMP8 mice in Morris water maze tests, similar to 150 mg/kg·day of resveratrol, a popular neuro-protective compound. Furthermore, TPFB treatment showed significant improvements in various  AD [MASK] in SAMP8 brains, which were restored to near control levels of the normal mice, SAMR1. TPFB significantly reduced the level of amyloid ß-peptide 42  (Aß42), inhibited hyperphosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein Tau, induced phosphorylation of Ser9 of the glycogen synthase kinase 3ß (GSK-3ß), and  decreased the expression of the proinflammatory cytokines TNFa, IL-6, and IL-1ß.  Finally, TPFB also markedly reduced the level of serum derivatives of reactive oxygen metabolites (d-ROMs), a biomarker of oxidative stress in vivo.

Results: Three hundred and sixty-two primary care practices in the East Midlands  were contacted of which only 41 (11% (95%CI 8-15%)) agreed to support the study.  These 41 practices posted 940 letters to potential participants. Thirty participants were enrolled in the cohort study of whom 9 were eligible for the antihypertensive withdrawal programme, 20 participated in a home blood pressure monitoring sub-group analysis and 12 took part in an interview study. Twenty-two  of those enrolled in the cohort study were followed up at 6 months. The withdrawal programme was acceptable to participants and general practitioners (GPs).

In human brain tissue data sets, both GNG4 and KCNQ2 show higher expression in hippocampus relative to other brain regions; GNG4 expression decreases with advancing age.

The many meta-analysis studies carried  out on large numbers of samples in different populations have not provided clear  results to date, because a trans-ethnic shift of risk genotypes in different populations is often observed. OBJECTIVES: To determine genotypes allele frequencies of the polymorphisms most frequently identified to be correlated with cardio-cerebrovascular disease and AD in a Southern Italy population and to investigate their possible association with dementia.

In elderly people, dementia with AD neuropathology and white matter lesions (WML) is common. In this context, olfactory impairment could also depend on the presence of WML. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cross-sectional relationship between olfaction and WML in elderly subjects with MCI. METHODS: Consecutive subjects, >65 years old, diagnosed as MCI after a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment in an expert memory center, with a brain MRI performed within a year and without major [MASK] state, were included. Olfaction was assessed by the Brief Smell Identification Test (BSIT). Two trained neuroradiologists, blind to cognitive and olfaction status, visually  assessed hippocampal atrophy according to Scheltens scale and WML according to Fazekas criteria. RESULTS: Seventy-five MCI subjects (mean age (SD)?=?77.1 (6.2) years, 74.7% of women) were included. After adjustment for age and sex, factors associated with low BSIT scores were older age (p?=?0.007), lower BMI (p?=?0.08), lower MMSE score (p?=?0.05), lower FCRST (p?=?0.008), hippocampal atrophy (p?=?0.04), periventricular WML (p?=?0.007), and deep WML burden (p?=?0.005). In multivariate analysis, severe deep WML (OR (95% CI)?=?6.29 (1.4-35.13), p?=?0.02) remained associated with low BSIT score independently from hippocampal atrophy. CONCLUSION: In elderly MCI subjects, low olfactory performances are associated with WML, whose progression may be slowed by vascular treatments.

      "[CLS] Recently, the significantly higher incidence of Alzheimers disease (AD) in women than in men has been attributed to the loss of neuroprotective estrogen after menopause. Does phytoestrogen have the ability to protect against amyloid-ß (Aß)  toxicity? The aim of this study was to evaluate hypothesis that ß-ecdysterone (ß-Ecd) protects SH-SY5Y cells from Aß-induced apoptosis by separate signaling pathways involving protein kinase B (Akt) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Here, we demonstrate that phytoestrogen ß-Ecd inhibits Aß-triggered mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, as indicated by Bcl-2/Bax ratio elevation, cytochrome c (cyt c) release reduction, and caspase-9 inactivation. Interestingly, ß-Ecd upregulates Bcl-2 expression in SH-SY5Y cells under both basal and Aß-challenged  conditions, but downregulates Bax expression only in Aß-challenged conditions. Subsequently, Akt-dependent NF-?B activation is required for Bcl-2 upregulation,  but not Bax downregulation, in response to ß-Ecd, which was validated by the use  of LY294002 and Bay11-7082. Notably, ß-Ecd attenuates the Aß-evoked reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) phosphorylation and JNK activation without altering the basal ASK1 phosphorylation and JNK activation. ROS-scavenging by diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) abrogated the ability of ß-Ecd to alter the activation of ASK1. Simultaneously, inhibition of JNK by SP600125 abolished ß-Ecd-induced Bax downregulation in Aß-challenged SH-SY5Y cells, whereas LY294002 failed to do so. Consequently, ß-Ecd possesses neuroprotection by different and complementary pathways, which together promote a Bcl-2/Bax [MASK] These data support our hypothesis and suggest that ß-Ecd is a promising candidate for the treatment of AD.

All participants completed counterbalanced neuropsychological testing using alternate test forms in both a teleneuropsychology and a traditional face-to-face (FTF) administration condition. Tests were selected based upon their common use in dementia evaluations, brevity, and assessment of multiple cognitive domains. Results from FTF and teleneuropsychology test conditions were compared using individual repeated measures ANCOVA, controlling for age, education, gender, and depression scores. Results: All ANCOVA models revealed significant main effects of group and a non-significant interaction between group and administration condition. All ANCOVA models revealed non-significant main effects for administration condition, except category fluency. Conclusions: Results derived from teleneuropsychologically administered tests can distinguish between cognitively impaired and non-impaired individuals similar to  traditional FTF assessment. This adds to the growing teleneuropsychology [MASK] by supporting the validity of remote assessments in aging populations. [SEP]\t\tliterature\n",

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Clinical and epidemiological studies of older persons have implicated clusterin in Alzheimers disease (AD) pathogenesis. In the context of identifying early biomarkers of risk, we examined [MASK] of plasma clusterin and characteristics of AD in middle-aged individuals from the community. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Subjects were 639 cognitively normal individuals (mean age 50 ± 3.5) from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Brain MRI sub-study. Clusterin was quantified using ELISA (mean 255± 31 ng/ml). Associations were assessed between clusterin and volumes of brain regions known to atrophy in early AD, including entorhinal cortex (ECV), hippocampus (HV), and  medial temporal lobe (MTLV) volumes (cm3). Total brain volume (TBV) and volumes of structures affected in later AD were examined for comparison. RESULTS: In multivariable models, higher clusterin had a negative non-linear association with ECV (combined left and right hemispheres), and this association  was influenced by the highest clusterin levels. Compared to mean clusterin, 1 and 2 standard deviation (SD) level increases in clusterin were associated with -2.1% (95% CI: -3.3,-0.9) and -7.3% (95% CI: -11.3,-3.3) lower ECV, respectively. Similar relationships were observed between clusterin and HV, although the relationship was stronger for left-side HV than the right-side. However, the association was not significant after adjusting for covariates. Negative non-linear [MASK] between clusterin and MTLV were strongest for the left side: compared to mean clusterin, 1 and 2 SD level increases in clusterin were associated with -0.9% (95% CI: -1.9, 0.1) and -3.7% (95% CI: -7.1, -0.3) lower MTLV. There were no significant [MASK] between clusterin and brain structures affected in later AD. CONCLUSIONS: In middle-aged adults unselected for AD, plasma clusterin was associated with lower volume of the entorhinal cortex, an area that atrophies early in AD. Clusterin could be informative as part of a multi-component preclinical marker for AD. [SEP]\t\tassociations\n",

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Differential diagnosis between dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimers disease (AD) is not straightforward, especially in [MASK] early stages of disease. We compared AD biomarkers (phospho-Tau181, total-Tau, Aß42 and Aß40)  in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with DLB and AD, focusing especially on  [MASK] prodromal stage. METHODS: A total of 1221 CSF were collected in different memory centres (ePLM network) in France and analysed retrospectively. Samples were obtained from patients with prodromal DLB (pro-DLB; n=57), DLB dementia (DLB-d; n=154), prodromal AD (pro-AD; n=132) and AD dementia (n=783), and control subjects (CS; n=95). These centres use [MASK] same diagnostic procedure and criteria to evaluate [MASK] patients. RESULTS: In patients with pro-DLB, CSF Aß42 levels appeared much less disrupted than in patients at [MASK] demented stage (DLB-d) (P<0.05 CS>pro-DLB; P<0.001 CS>DLB-d). On average, Aß40 levels in patients with DLB (pro-DLB and DLB-d) were  much below those in patients with pro-AD (P<0.001?DLB groups<pro-AD). The Aß42/Aß40 ratio in patients with pro-DLB remained close to that of CS. t-Tau and  phospho-Tau181 levels were unaltered in patients with DLB (pro-DLB and DLB-d). CONCLUSIONS: Reduced levels of CSF Aß42 were found in patients with DLB but ra[MASK]r at a later stage, reaching those of patients with AD, in whom Aß42 levels  were decreased even at [MASK] prodromal stage. At [MASK] prodromal stage of DLB, [MASK] majority of patients presented a normal CSF profile.

Subjects received a single 50-mg lanabecestat dose as solution, tablet [MASK] or tablet B on day 1 of each crossover period; 14 of 16 subjects completed the study. Relative bioavailability based on plasma lanabecestat AUC0-8 (area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve from zero to infinity) geometric mean ratio versus oral  solution (primary variable) was: tablet [MASK] 1.052 (90% confidence interval [CI], 1.001-1.106); tablet B, 1.040 (0.989-1.093).

All 3 formulations had similar plasma lanabecestat concentration-time profiles. Six adverse events were reported by 6 subjects (37.5%, all mild). GastroPlus modeling predicted a negligible impact of gastric pH changes on systemic PK (up to pH 7.4).

      "[CLS] Over recent decades, epidemiology has made significant contributions to our understanding of dementia, translating scientific discoveries into population health. Here, we propose reframing dementia epidemiology as \"population neuroscience,\" blending techniques and models from contemporary neuroscience with those of epidemiology and biostatistics. On the basis of emerging evidence and newer paradigms and methods, population neuroscience will minimize the bias typical of traditional clinical research, identify the relatively homogenous subgroups that comprise the general population, and investigate broader and denser phenotypes of dementia and cognitive impairment. Long-term follow-up of sufficiently large study cohorts will allow the identification of cohort [MASK]  and critical windows of exposure. Molecular epidemiology and omics will allow us  to unravel the key distinctions within and among subgroups and better understand  individuals risk profiles. Interventional epidemiology will allow us to identify the different subgroups that respond to different treatment/prevention strategies. These strategies will inform precision medicine. In addition, insights into interactions between disease biology, personal and environmental factors, and social determinants of health will allow us to measure and track disease in communities and improve population health.

      "[CLS] The impairment of hippocampal neurogenesis at the early stages of Alzheimers disease (AD) is believed to support early cognitive decline. Converging studies sustain the idea that vitamin D might be linked to the pathophysiology of AD and  to hippocampal neurogenesis. Nothing being known about the effects of vitamin D on hippocampal neurogenesis in AD, we assessed them in a mouse model of AD. In a  previous study, we observed that dietary vitamin D supplementation in female AD-like mice reduced cognitive decline only when [MASK] during the symptomatic phase. With these data in hand, we wondered whether the consequences of vitamin D administration on hippocampal neurogenesis are stage-dependent. Male wild-type and transgenic AD-like mice (5XFAD model) were fed with a diet containing either  no vitamin D (0VD) or a normal dose of vitamin D (NVD) or a high dose of vitamin  D (HVD), from month 1 to month 6 (preventive arm) or from month 4 to month 9 (curative arm). Working memory was assessed using the Y-maze, while amyloid burden, astrocytosis, and neurogenesis were quantified using immunohistochemistry. In parallel, the effects of vitamin D on proliferation and  differentiation were assayed on primary cultures of murine neural progenitor cells. Improved working memory and neurogenesis were observed when high vitamin D supplementation was administered during the early phases of the disease, while a  normal dose of vitamin D increased neurogenesis during the late phases. Conversely, an early hypovitaminosis D increased the number of amyloid plaques in AD mice while a late hypovitaminosis D impaired neurogenesis in AD and WT mice. The observed in vivo vitamin D-associated increased neurogenesis was partially substantiated by an augmented in vitro proliferation but not an increased differentiation of neural progenitors into neurons. Finally, a sexual dimorphism  was observed. Vitamin D supplementation improved the working memory of males and  females, when [MASK] during the pre-symptomatic and symptomatic phases, respectively. Our study establishes that (i) neurogenesis is improved by vitamin  D in a male mouse model of AD, in a time-dependent manner, and (ii) cognition is  enhanced in a gender-associated way. Additional pre-clinical studies are required to further understand the gender- and time-specific mechanisms of action of vitamin D in AD.

      "[CLS] Neurogenesis might influence oligodendrogenesis and selectively instruct myelination in the mammalian brain. Running exercise could induce neurogenesis and protect the myelin sheaths in the dentate gyrus of AD mice. It is unclear whether running exercise can protect myelin sheaths in the absence of neurogenesis in the hippocampus of AD mice. Six-month-old male APP/PS1 transgenic mice were randomly assigned to a control group (Tg control) or a running group (Tg runner), and age-matched non-transgenic littermates were used as a wild-type  group (WT control). The Tg runner mice were subjected to a running protocol for four months. The behaviors of the mice in the three groups were then assessed using the Morris water maze, and related quantitative parameters of the myelin sheaths within the CA1 [MASK] were investigated using unbiased stereological and electron microscopy techniques. Learning and spatial memory performance, CA1 volume, the volumes of the myelinated fibers, and myelin sheaths in the CA1 [MASK] were all significantly worse in the Tg control mice than in the WT control mice.

We quantified markers of amyloid ß (total Aß, Aß-40, Aß-42, and  soluble Aß) and hyperphosphorylated tau in the hippocampal formation and entorhinal cortex of 94 subjects consisting of normal controls (n = 12), vascular dementia, VaD (17), post-stroke demented, PSD (n = 15), and post-stroke non-demented, PSND (n = 23), Alzheimers disease, AD (n = 14), and mixed AD and vascular dementia, AD_VAD (n = 13) using immunohistochemical techniques.

Tau immunoreactivity showed highest expression in the AD and mixed AD and vascular dementia, AD_VaD, which was higher than in control, post - stroke and VaD groups [MASK] < 0.05). APOE e4 allele positivity was associated with higher expression of amyloid and tau pathology in the subiculum and entorhinal cortex of post-stroke cases [MASK] < 0.05).

      "[CLS] Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is believed to play an important role in the etiology of Alzheimers disease (AD). The accumulation of misfolded proteins and  perturbation of intracellular calcium homeostasis are thought to underlie the induction of ER stress, resulting in neuronal dysfunction and cell death. Several reports have shown an increased ER stress response in amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin1 (PS1) double-transgenic (Tg) AD mouse models. However, whether the ER stress observed in these mouse models is actually caused by AD pathology remains unclear. APP and PS1 contain one and nine transmembrane domains, respectively, for which it has been postulated that overexpressed membrane proteins can become wedged in a misfolded configuration in ER membranes, thereby inducing nonspecific ER stress. Here, we used an App-knockin (KI) AD mouse model that accumulates amyloid-ß (Aß) peptide without overexpressing APP to investigate whether the ER stress response is heightened because of Aß pathology. Thorough examinations indicated that no ER stress responses arose in App-KI or single APP-Tg mice. These results suggest that PS1 overexpression or mutation induced a nonspecific ER stress response that was independent of Aß pathology in  the double-Tg mice. Moreover, we observed no ER stress in a mouse model of tauopathy (P301S-Tau-Tg mice) at various ages, suggesting that ER stress is also  not essential in tau pathology-induced neurodegeneration.

Strongly connected nodes displayed more tau pathology in Alzheimers disease, independently of intrinsic connectivity network, validating the predictions of theories of trans-neuronal spread but not supporting a role for metabolic demands or deficient trophic support in tau accumulation. This was not a compensatory phenomenon, as the functional consequence of increasing tau burden in Alzheimers disease was a progressive weakening of the connectivity of these same [MASK] reducing weighted degree and local efficiency and resulting in weaker small-world properties. Conversely, in PSP, unlike in Alzheimers disease, those nodes that accrued pathological tau were those that displayed graph metric  properties associated with increased metabolic demand and a lack of trophic support rather than strong functional connectivity. Together, these findings go some way towards explaining why Alzheimers disease affects large scale connectivity networks throughout cortex while neuropathology in PSP is concentrated in a small number of subcortical structures. Further, we demonstrate that in PSP increasing tau burden in midbrain and deep nuclei was associated with strengthened cortico-cortical functional connectivity. Disrupted cortico-subcortical and cortico-brainstem interactions meant that information transfer took less direct paths, passing through a larger number of cortical [MASK] reducing closeness centrality and eigenvector centrality in PSP, while increasing weighted degree, clustering, betweenness centrality and local efficiency. Our results have wide-ranging implications, from the validation of models of tau trafficking in humans to understanding the relationship between regional tau burden and brain functional reorganization.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis of Alzheimers disease (AD) and its onset in subjects affected by mild cognitive impairment (MCI) based on structural MRI features is one of the most important open issues in neuroimaging. Accordingly, a scientific  challenge has been promoted, on the international Kaggle platform, to assess the  performance of [MASK] classification methods for prediction of MCI and its conversion to AD. NEW METHOD: This work presents a classification strategy based on Random Forest feature selection and Deep Neural Network classification using a mixed cohort including the four classes of classification problem, that is HC, AD, MCI and cMCI, to train the model. Moreover, we compare this approach with a novel classification strategy based on fuzzy logic learned on a mixed cohort including  only HC and AD. EXPERIMENTS: A training set of 240 subjects and a test set including mixed cohort of 500 real and simulated subjects were used. The data included AD patients, MCI  subjects converting to AD (cMCI), MCI subjects and healthy controls (HC). This work ranked third for overall accuracy (38.8%) over 19 participating teams. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S): The \"International challenge for automated prediction of MCI from MRI data\" hosted by the Kaggle platform has been promoted  to validate [MASK] methodologies with a common set of data and evaluation procedures. CONCLUSION: DNNs reach a classification accuracy significantly higher than other  machine learning strategies; on the other hand, fuzzy logic is particularly accurate with cMCI, suggesting a combination of these approaches could lead to interesting future perspectives.

      "[CLS] Astrocytes participate in the development and resolution of neuroinflammation in  numerous ways, including the release of cytokines and growth factors. Among many, astrocytes release transforming growth factors beta (TGF-ß) TGF-ß1, TGF-ß2 and TGF-ß3. TGF-ß1 is the most studied isoform, while production and release of TGF-ß2 and TGF-ß3 by astrocytes have been poorly characterized. Here, we report that purified cultures of hippocampal astrocytes produce mainly TGF-ß3 followed by TGF-ß2 and TGF-ß1. Furthermore, astrocytes release principally the active form of TGF-ß3 over the other two. Changes in release of TGF-ß were sensitive to the calcineurin (CaN) inhibitor FK506. Starvation had no effect on TGF-ß1 and TGF-ß3  while TGF-ß2 mRNA was significantly up-regulated in a CaN-dependent manner. We further investigated production and release of astroglial TGF-ß in Alzheimers disease-related conditions. Oligomeric ß-amyloid (Aß) down-regulated TGF-ß1, while up-regulating TGF-ß2 and TGF-ß3, in a CaN-dependent manner. In cultured hippocampal astrocytes from 3xTg-AD mice, TGF-ß2 and TGF-ß3, but not TGF-ß1, were up-regulated, and this was CaN-independent. In hippocampal tissues from symptomatic 3xTg-AD mice, TGF-ß2 was up-regulated with respect to control mice. Finally, treatment with recombinant TGF-ßs showed that TGF-ß2 and TGF-ß3 significantly reduced PSD95 protein in cultured hippocampal neurons, and this effect was paralleled by conditioned [MASK] from Aß-treated astrocytes or from astrocytes from 3xTg-AD mice. Taken together, our data suggest that TGF-ß2 and TGF-ß3 are produced by astrocytes in a CaN-dependent manner and should be investigated further in the context of astrocyte-[MASK]ted neurodegeneration.

      "[CLS] The incidence of Alzheimers disease ([MASK]) is higher in elderly women than in men. The molecular background of this gender-related risk, however, is largely unknown. In a previous proteomics study, we identified significantly elevated levels of monoamine oxidase-B and tropomyosin-1 in [MASK] patients, together with significant changes of the genetic [MASK] risk factors apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) and  glutathione S-transferase omega 1 (GSTO1), in platelets - a promising source for  [MASK] blood biomarkers. The present study aimed to investigate the gender-specificity as well as the disease-stage dependency of these biomarkers in [MASK] patients and those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Tropomyosin-1 and monoamine oxidase-B protein levels were quantified by 2-D DIGE and 1-D Western blotting. Here, for the first time, we revealed a significant increase of 38&39kDa tropomyosin-1 protein levels in female but not male [MASK] (+56%; p=0.008) and MCI patients (+46%; p=0.041) measured by 1-D WB. In contrast, levels of monoamine oxidase-B were, independently of gender, elevated in [MASK] patients (+52%; p=0.009) but unaltered in MCI compared to control subjects. Moreover, we confirmed that APOE4-positive females are at a higher risk (OR=18.7; p=9.7E-09) of developing [MASK] compared to APOE4-positive males (OR=6.5; p=5.9E-04).

      "[CLS] Introduction: Previously, we discussed several critical barriers in including [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ([18F]FDG-PET) imaging of preclinical Alzheimers disease (AD) subjects. These factors included the reference region selection and intensity normalization of PET images and the within- and across-subject variability of affected brain regions. In this study,  we utilized a [MASK] FDG-PET analysis, the regional FDG time correlation coefficient, rFTC, that can address and resolve these barriers and provide a more sensitive way of monitoring longitudinal changes in metabolism of cognitively normal elderly adults. The rFTC analysis captures the within-subject similarities between baseline and follow-up regional radiotracer distributions. Methods: The rFTC trajectories of 27 cognitively normal subjects were calculated  to identify 1) trajectories of rFTC decline in individual cognitively normal subjects; 2) how these trajectories correlate with the subjects cognitive test scores, baseline cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of amyloid beta (Aß), and apolipoprotein E4 (APOE-E4) status; and 3) whether similar trajectories are observed in regional/composite standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) values. Results: While some of the subjects maintained a stable rFTC trajectory, other subjects had declining and fluctuating rFTC values. We found that the rFTC decline was significantly higher in APOE-E4 carriers compared to noncarriers (p=0.04). We also found a marginally significant association between rFTC decline and cognitive decline measured by Alzheimers Disease Assessment Scale - cognitive subscale (ADAS_cog) decline (0.05). In comparison to the rFTC trajectories, the composite region of interest (ROI) SUVR trajectories did not change in any of the subjects. No individual/composite ROI SUVR changes contributed significantly to explaining changes in ADAS_cog, conversion to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or any general changes in clinical symptoms. Conclusion: The rFTC decline may serve as a new biomarker of early metabolic changes before the MCI stage. [SEP]\t\tnovel\n",

      "[CLS] Na+/Ca2+ exchangers (NCXs) are expressed primarily in the plasma membrane of most cell types, where they mediate electrogenic exchange of one Ca2+ for three Na+ ions, depending on Ca2+ and Na+ electrochemical gradients across the membrane. Three mammalian NCX isoforms (NCX1, NCX2, and NCX3) are each encoded by a distinct gene. Here, we report that NCX2 and NCX3 protein and mRNA levels are relatively reduced in hippocampal CA1 of APP23 and APP-KI mice. Likewise, NCX2+/- or NCX3+/- mice exhibited impaired hippocampal LTP and memory-related behaviors.  Moreover, relative to controls, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) autophosphorylation significantly decreased in NCX2+/- mouse hippocampus but increased in hippocampus of NCX3+/- mice. NCX2 or NCX3 heterozygotes displayed impaired maintenance of hippocampal LTP, a phenotype that in NCX2+/- mice was correlated with elevated calcineurin activity and rescued by treatment with the calcineurin (CaN) inhibitor FK506. Likewise, FK506 treatment significantly restored impaired hippocampal LTP in APP-KI mice. Moreover, Ca2+ clearance after depolarization following high frequency stimulation was slightly  delayed in hippocampal CA1 regions of NCX2+/- mice. Electron microscopy revealed  relatively decreased synaptic [MASK] in CA1 of NCX2+/- mice, while the number of spines with perforated synapses in CA1 significantly increased in NCX3+/- mice. We conclude that memory impairment seen in NCX2+/- and NCX3+/- mice reflect dysregulated hippocampal CaMKII activity, which alters dendritic spine morphology, findings with implications for memory deficits seen in Alzheimers disease model mice.

If so, a hypothesized treatment, intranasal glucocorticoids, might be effective.

METHOD: We collected relevant publications, during the period of 2000 to 2016, emphasizing in vivo and in vitro studies with neurological assessment of flavonols potentials, as well as classifying studies according to evidence levels, in order to elucidate evidence-based literature and its application on clinical research. In addition, we highlight the importance of flavonols in modern research fields, indicating their neuroprotective potential and use thereof as preventive and therapeutic treatment of numerous neurodegenerative disease.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Cognitive functions progressively deteriorate during aging and neurodegenerative diseases. The present study aims at investigating differences in working memory performance as well as functional brain changes during the earliest stages of cognitive decline in health elderly individuals. METHODS: 62 elderly individuals (41 females), including 41 controls (35 females)  and 21 middle cognitive impairment subjects (6 females), underwent neuropsychological assessment at baseline and an fMRI examination in a N-back paradigm contrasting 2-back vs. 0-back condition. Upon a 18 months follow-up, we  identified stable controls (sCON) with preserved cognition and deteriorating controls (dCON) with -1SD decrease of performances in at least two neuropsychological tests. Data analyses included accuracy and reaction time (RT)  for the 2-back condition and general linear model [MASK] for the fMRI sequence. RESULTS: At the behavioral level, sCON and dCON performed better than MCI in terms of accuracy and reaction time. At the brain level, functional differences in regions of the fronto-parietal network (FPN) and of the Default Mode Network (DFM) were observed. Significantly lower neural activations in the bilateral inferior and middle frontal gyri were found in MCI versus both dCON / sCON and for dCON versus sCON. Significantly increased activations in the anterior cingulate cortex and posterior cingulate cortex and bilateral insula were found in MCI versus both dCON / sCON and in dCON versus sCON.

      "[CLS] Locus coeruleus-noradrenergic system dysfunction is known to contribute to the progression of Alzheimers disease (AD). Besides a variety of reports showing the involvement of norepinephrine and its receptor systems in cognition, amyloid ß (Aß) metabolism, neuroinflammation, and neurogenesis, little is known about the contribution of the specific receptors to these actions. Here, we investigated the neurogenic and neuroprotective properties of a new a2 adrenoblocker, mesedin, in astroglial primary cultures (APC) from C57BL/6 and 3×Tg-AD mice. Our results demonstrate that mesedin rescues neuronal precursors and young neurons, and reduces the [MASK] dehydrogenase (LDH) release from astroglia under hypoxic and  normoxic conditions. Mesedin also increased choline acetyltransferase, postsynaptic density marker 95 (PSD95), and Aß-degrading enzyme neprilysin in the wild type APC, while in the 3×Tg-AD APC exposed to glutamate, it decreased the intracellular content of Aß and enhanced the survival of synaptophysin-positive astroglia and neurons. These effects in APC can at least partially be attributed  to the mesedins ability of increasing the expression of Interleukine(IL)-10, which is a potent anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective neurogenic, and Aß metabolism enhancing factor. In summary, our data identify the neurogenic, neuroprotective, and anti-amyloidogenic action of mesedin in APC. Further in vivo studies are needed to estimate the therapeutic value of mesedin for AD.

      "[CLS] ß-Amyloid peptide (Aß) is the main component of senile plaques in patients with Alzheimers disease, and is known to be a main pathogenic factor of the disease.  Recent evidence indicates that activation of NADPH oxidase (NOX) in microglia or  astrocytes may be a source of Aß-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS). We investigated the role of neuronal NOX in Aß-induced neuronal death in mouse mixed cortical cultures. Cell death was assessed by measuring lactate dehydrogenase efflux to bathing media 24 or 48 hr after exposure to Aß25-35, a fragment of Aß with an equivalent neurotoxic effect. Aß25-35 induced neuronal death in concentration- and time- dependent manners with apoptotic features. Neuronal death was significantly attenuated, not only by anti-apoptotic drugs, such as z-VAD-fmk and cycloheximide, but also by antioxidants, such as trolox, ascorbic acid, and epigallocatethin gallate. We also demonstrated that treatment with 20 µM Aß25-35 increased fluorescent signals in mixed cortical cultures, but produced only weak signals in pure astrocyte cultures in the presence of 2,7-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCF-DA), an indicator for intracellular ROS.  Increased DCF-DA [MASK] was markedly inhibited, not only by trolox, but also by selective NOX inhibitors, such as apocynin and AEBSF. Western blot analyses revealed that Aß25-35 increased the expression of gp91phox, a main subunit of NOX in cells. The above antioxidants, apocynin, and AEBSF significantly attenuated neuronal death induced by Aß25-35. Furthermore, the gp91phox-specific siRNA-based knockdown of NOX significantly inhibited neuronal death. These results suggest that activation of neuronal NOX is involved in Aß25-35-induced neuronal death. [SEP]\t\tfluorescence\n",

D-PUFAs consistently improved performance in cognitive/memory tests, essentially resetting performance of the D-PUFA-fed Aldh2-/- mice to that of wild-type mice fed a typical laboratory diet. D-PUFAs therefore represent a promising new strategy to broadly reduce rates of LPO, and  combat cognitive decline in AD. [SEP]\t\tcontaining\n",

      "[CLS] Polyphenol compounds, such as curcumin, rutin, rifampicin, can inhibit Aß aggregation and decrease reactive oxygen species (ROS), and have received much attention in recent years for Alzheimers disease (AD) treatment. However, the excess metal ions in amyloid plaque can chelate to polyphenol compounds. It significantly declines the efficacy of polyphenol compounds when used in the clinic. In this report, a near-infrared (NIR)-caged upconversion responsive system UCNP@SiO2 @Cur/CQ is designed and synthesized to control drug sequential release by regulating NIR laser. When the system is irradiated at low intensity of the NIR laser, the caged metal chelator, clioquinol (CQ), is first released for removing free metal ions, which affects the efficacy of curcumin. Subsequently, the strongly caged curcumin is released with increasing the intensity of NIR light. In this way, the treatment efficacy of curcumin is improved. This NIR-caged drug release system can not only remove Cu2+ but also clean superfluous ROS. [MASK] developing controllable sequential drug releasing may provide clinical benefits of combination treatment of AD. To the best of our knowledge, this work reports for the first time that a sequentially controlled system can overcome the interference of metal ions on polyphenol compounds for AD treatment.

      "[CLS] Loss of neuronal proteostasis, a common feature of the aging brain, is accelerated in neurodegenerative disorders, including different types of tauopathies. Aberrant turnover of tau, a microtubule-stabilizing protein, contributes to its accumulation and subsequent toxicity in tauopathy patients brains. A direct toxic effect of pathogenic forms of tau on the proteolytic systems that normally contribute to their turnover has been proposed. In this study, we analyzed the contribution of three different types of [MASK] macro[MASK] chaperone-mediated [MASK] and endosomal microautophagy to the degradation of tau protein variants and tau mutations associated with this age-related disease. We have found that the pathogenic P301L mutation inhibits degradation of tau by any of the three autophagic pathways, whereas the risk-associated tau mutation A152T reroutes tau for degradation through a different autophagy pathway. We also found defective autophagic degradation of tau when using mutations that mimic common posttranslational modifications in tau or known to promote its aggregation. Interestingly, although most mutations markedly reduced degradation of tau through [MASK] the step of this process preferentially affected varies depending on the type of tau mutation.

      "[CLS] OBJECTIVE: To investigate the associations bet[MASK]en age, vascular health, and Alzheimer disease (AD) imaging biomarkers in an elderly sample. METHODS: We identified 430 individuals along the cognitive continuum aged >60 years with amyloid positron emission tomography (PET), tau PET, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging. A subset of 329 individuals had fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET. We ascertained presently existing cardiovascular and metabolic conditions (CMC) from health care records and used the summation of presence/absence of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cardiac arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and stroke as a surrogate for vascular health. We used global amyloid from Pittsburgh compound B PET, entorhinal cortex tau uptake  (ERC-tau) from tau-PET, and neurodegeneration in AD signature regions from MRI and FDG-PET as surrogates for AD pathophysiology. We dichotomized participants into CMC = 0 (CMC- ) versus CMC > 0 (CMC+ ) and tested for age-adjusted group differences in AD biomarkers. Using structural equation models (SEMs), [MASK] assessed the impact of vascular health on AD biomarker cascade (amyloid leads to  tau leads to neurodegeneration) after considering the direct and indirect age, sex, and apolipoprotein E effects. RESULTS: CMC+ participants had significantly greater neurodegeneration than CMC-  participants but did not differ by amyloid or ERC-tau. The SEMs sho[MASK]d that (1) vascular health had a significant direct and indirect impact on neurodegeneration but not on amyloid; and (2) vascular health, specifically the presence of hyperlipidemia, had a significant direct impact on ERC-tau.

METHODS: We measured carotid to femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) using applanation tonometry, and we assessed depression using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)  in a cohort of participants from The Maastricht Study. Logistic and negative binominal models were adjusted for [MASK], type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and CVD risk factors. RESULTS: We included 2757 participants in our analyses (48.8% men, mean [MASK] 59.8  ± 8.1 yr, 27% T2DM). We found that cfPWV was associated with MDD in men (fully adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.36, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.45-3.84), but not in women (OR 1.57, 95% CI 0.93-2.66), [MASK]d 60 years or younger. The ORs were not  significant in individuals older than 60 years (men: OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.63-1.68; women: OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.32-1.31). Similarly, cfPWV was associated with a higher  PHQ-9 score in men (rate ratio 1.28, 95% CI 1.09-1.52), but not in women (rate ratio 1.11, 95% CI 0.99-1.23), [MASK]d 60 years or younger.

METHODS: To investigate the potential mechanisms of Rg1 in ß-amyloid [MASK] SH-SY5Y cells, a comparative proteomic analysis was performed using stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture combined with nano-LC-MS/MS. RESULTS: We identified a total of 1,149 proteins in three independent experiments. Forty-nine proteins were significantly altered by Rg1 after exposure of the cells to ß-amyloid peptides. The protein interaction network analysis showed that these altered proteins were clustered in ribosomal proteins, mitochondria, the actin cytoskeleton, and splicing proteins. Among these proteins, mitochondrial proteins containing HSD17B10, AARS2, TOMM40, VDAC1, COX5A, and NDUFA4 were associated with mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of AD.

MBI is an \"at risk\" state for incident cognitive decline and dementia, and for some, MBI is the index manifestation of neurodegeneration, observed in advance of cognitive impairment. Initially described in Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), MBI evolved to describe a preclinical stage of all cause dementia, and has been operationalized in the International Society to Advance Alzheimers Research and  Treatment-Alzheimers Association (ISTAART-AA) proposed research diagnostic criteria. Here, we describe three cases in which patients diagnosed with a variety of dementing conditions initially presented with NPS to the Cognitive Neurosciences Clinic at the University of Calgary, Canada. All patients described in our series were given a final diagnosis of dementia; the etiology supported by clinical, cognitive, and neuroimaging findings. In all three cases, the progression to dementia was preceded by NPS that meet criteria for MBI. With these examples, we are able to illustrate that MBI can represent a premonitory stage of dementia of different etiologies. These cases demonstrate early use of the MBI checklist (MBI-C). The cases presented in this series serve as examples of NPS as early manifestations of dementia. Our case examples [MASK] both FTD and AD, and demonstrate that before a diagnosis of a neurodegenerative disease is considered, often patients will be diagnosed with and treated for a psychiatric condition.

To that end, we studied PS1- and PS2-dependent substrate processing in murine cells lacking presenilins (PSs) (PS1KO, PS2KO or PS1-PS2 double-KO noted PSdKO) or stably re-expressing human PS1 or PS2 in an endogenous PS-null (PSdKO) background.

DESIGN: We registered and conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO: CRD42015023497) of observational studies. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL Plus to February 2017. Quantitative synthesis was performed where data allowed. SETTING: Acute and rehabilitation hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Adults hospitalized for stroke who were newly admitted directly to  long-term institutional care at the time of hospital discharge. MEASUREMENTS: Factors associated with new institutionalization. RESULTS: From 10,420 records, we included 18 studies (n = 32,139 participants). The studies were heterogeneous and conducted in Europe, North America, and East Asia. Eight studies were at high risk of selection bias. The proportion of those  surviving to discharge who were newly discharged to long-term care varied from 7% to 39% (median 17%, interquartile range 12%), and the model of care received in the long-term care setting was not defined. Older [MASK] and greater stroke severity had a consistently positive association with the need for long-term care admission.

In globally affected brains, intra-cerebral pseudo reference regions are not feasible. Consequently, many brain-independent approaches have been attempted, including SUV analysis and normalization to muscle- or heart uptake, aiming to stabilize [MASK] analysis. In this study, we systematically compared different image normalization methods for static late phase TSPO-PET imaging of rodent brain. METHODS: We first obtained gamma counter measurements for gold standard quantitation of [18F]GE180 uptake in brain of C57Bl/6 mice (N = 10) after PET, aiming to identify factors contributing significantly to the [MASK] results. Subsequently, data from a large cohort of C57Bl/6 mice (N = 79) were compiled to precisely determine the weighted influence and variance attributable  these factors by regression analysis. Scan-rescan variability and agreement with  histology were used to validate the tested normalization methods in an Alzheimers disease (AD) mouse model with pathologically increased TSPO expression (PS2APP; N = 24). Longitudinal data from AD model mice (N = 10) scanned at four different ages were used to challenge and validate the different  normalization methods in a practical application. RESULTS: Gamma counter results revealed that injected dose, body weight and PET-measured radioactivity concentration in the ventral myocardium all significantly accounted for [18F]GE180 activity in the brain. Skeletal muscle activity had high test-retest variance in this PET only application and was therefore pursued no further. Regression analysis of the large scale evaluation showed that scaling to injected dose or SUV analysis accounted for little variance in brain activity (R2 < 0.5), but inclusion of myocardial activity together with injected dose and body weight in the regression model accounted for most of the variance in brain uptake (R2 = 0.94). Scan-rescan stability, correlation with histology and applicability for longitudinal examination in the  disease model were also significantly improved by inclusion of myocadial uptake in the [MASK] model. CONCLUSION: Cerebral and myocardial TSPO expression are highly coupled under physiological conditions.

Furthermore, we are proposing two plausible binding modes obtained through in silico docking, which provide insights into the structural basis of the activity of the two series of compounds reported herein.

      "[CLS] The frontal aslant tract (FAT) has been described as a bundle connecting the Brocas area to the supplementary motor area (SMA) and the pre-SMA in both hemispheres. The functional properties of this tract and its role in degenerative dementia, such as Alzheimers disease (AD), still need to be fully clarified. The aim of this study was to explore the microstructural integrity of the FAT in patients with AD and its potential relationship with cognitive functioning. Twenty-three patients with AD and 25 healthy subjects (HS) were enrolled. All subjects underwent cognitive and MRI examination. MRI, including diffusion sequences, was [MASK] for probabilistic tractography analysis. We reconstructed individual FATs bilaterally and assessed their microstructural integrity using fractional anisotropy (FA), computed as both mean tract value and voxel-wise using SPM-8. Mean FA values were then [MASK] to test for correlations with cognitive measures. Mean tract FA and voxel-wise analyses revealed that patients  with AD, compared to HS, had decreased FA in the FAT bilaterally. In addition, positive associations were found between FA in the FATs and patients performance at tests for constructional praxis and visuospatial logical reasoning. The present results reveal a bilateral damage of FAT in AD patients. The association  between FATs microscopic abnormalities and constructive abilities fits well with the knowledge of a functional involvement of SMA and pre-SMA in movement sequences when executing constructive praxis tasks. The FAT is an associative bundle critically involved in the network sub-serving constructional praxis in patients with AD. [SEP]\t\tused\n",

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: The behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) has a broad differential diagnosis including other neurological and psychiatric disorders. Psychiatric misdiagnoses occur in up to 50% of bvFTD patients. Numbers on misdiagnosis of bvFTD in psychiatric disorders are lacking. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to investigate the frequency and characteristics of bvFTD misdiagnoses in psychiatric disorders and other neurologic disorders. METHODS: Thirty-five patients with a (possible or probable) bvFTD diagnosis made  by specialized memory clinic neurologists were included. Change in diagnosis after consulting a psychiatrist at baseline was recorded as well as change in diagnosis after two years of multidisciplinary neuropsychiatric follow-up. Differences in cognitive and behavioral profiles were investigated per diagnostic group after follow-up (bvFTD, psychiatry, other neurologic disorders). Clinical profiles are described in detail. RESULTS: In 17 patients (48.5%), the bvFTD baseline diagnosis changed: Two at baseline after psychiatric consultation, and 15 after two years of multidisciplinary follow-up. Eleven (64.5%) of these 17 patients [MASK] of total) were reclassified with a psychiatric diagnosis. We found no differences for cognitive baseline profiles between patients with bvFTD versus psychiatric diagnoses. CONCLUSION: In almost half of cases, the initial bvFTD diagnosis was changed after follow-up, most often into a psychiatric disorder. A multidisciplinary neuropsychiatric approach in the diagnostic process of bvFTD results in the identification of treatable disorders. Our findings illustrate a limited specificity of the [18F]FDG-PET-scan and the bvFTD criteria in a neuropsychiatric cohort, especially combined with certain clinical symptoms, like disinhibition, apathy, or loss of empathy.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of specific proactive semantic interference deficits as they relate to functi[MASK]al magnetic res[MASK]ance imaging (fMRI) neocortical and limbic functi[MASK]al c[MASK]nectivity in middle aged offspring of individuals with LOAD (O-LOAD) and age-equivalent c[MASK]trols. METHODS: We examined 21 O-LOAD and 20 c[MASK]trols without family history of neurodegenerative disorders (CS) [MASK] traditi[MASK]al measures of cognitive functi[MASK]ing and the LASSI-L, a novel semantic interference test uniquely sensitive to the failure to recover from proactive interference (frPSI). Cognitive tests then were correlated to fMRI c[MASK]nectivity of seeds located in entorhinal cortex and anterodorsal thalamic nuclei am[MASK]g O-LOAD and CS participants. RESULTS: Relative to CS, O-LOAD participants evidenced lower c[MASK]nectivity between entorhinal cortex and orbitofr[MASK]tal, anterior cingulate, and anterior temporal cortex. In the offspring of LOAD patients, LASSI-L measures of frPSI were inversely associated with c[MASK]nectivity between anterodorsal thalamus and c[MASK]tralateral posterior cingulate. Intrusi[MASK]s [MASK] the task related to frPSI were inversely correlated with a widespread c[MASK]nectivity network involving hippocampal, insular, posterior cingulate, and dorsolateral prefr[MASK]tal cortices,  al[MASK]g with precunei and anterior thalamus in this group. Different patterns of c[MASK]nectivity associated with frPSI were observed am[MASK]g c[MASK]trols.

      "[CLS] Alzheimers disease (AD) is a progressive, multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder that is the main cause of dementia. To date, there are no definitive diagnostic tests that can predict or assess onset and progression of the disease. Blood biomarkers for AD are being sought for many years but their identification  remains a challenging task. In this study, we investigated the potential relationship between AD and levels of acyl-peptide hydrolase (APEH) and proteasome in erythrocyte samples of 52 participants (26 AD and 26 cognitively healthy controls). A statistically significant decrease in proteasome and exopeptidase/endopeptidase APEH activities was found in AD samples compared to [MASK] of healthy controls. Moreover, in contrast to what was observed for proteasome transcripts, APEH activities reduction in AD patients was unrelated to its gene expression levels, suggesting the occurrence of posttranslational modifications or the expression of endogenous inhibitors that might impair enzyme activity. These preliminary data further support a relationship between the APEH-proteasome system and AD molecular players, providing the first evidence of  its potential use as a novel blood-based indicator for the routine detection of AD.

RESULTS: TOMM40 mRNA expression was significantly lower in AD subjects (0.87±0.18 versus 1.0±0.23, p?=?0.005), and PINK1 mRNA expression was higher in AD subjects  (1.5±0.61 versus 1.0±0.52, p?<?0.001). TOMM40 mRNA expression was significantly correlated with the Mini-Mental State Examination total score (r?=?0.290, p?=?0.027). There was no expressional change in peripheral APOE mRNA in either AD or control subjects (p?=?0.32).

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Brain lesions in Alzheimers disease (AD) are characterized by Aß accumulation, neurofibrillary tangles, [MASK] synaptic [MASK] neuronal vanishing. According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, Aß1-42 oligomers could trigger a neurotoxic cascade with kinase activation that leads to tau phosphorylation [MASK] neurodegeneration. Detrimental pathways that are associated with kinase activation could also be linked to the triggering of direct neuronal death, the production of free radicals, [MASK] neuroinflammation. RESULTS: Among these kinases, PKR (eukaryotic initiation factor 2a kinase 2) is a pro-apoptotic enzyme that inhibits translation [MASK] that has been implicated in several molecular pathways that lead to AD brain lesions [MASK] disturbed memory formation. PKR accumulates in degenerating neurons [MASK] is activated by Aß1-42 neurotoxicity. It might modulate Aß synthesis through BACE 1 induction.

METHODS: The data for this study, consisted of 2287 older adults aged 60 years and above, drawn from a nationally representative population-based survey entitled \"Determinants of Wellness among Older Malaysians: A Health Promotion Perspective\" conducted in 2009. RESULTS: The mean age of the respondents was 68.7 (SD=6.6) years. The average score of cognitive [MASK], measured by MMSE was 24.5 (SD=5.6). About 40% of the respondents were classified as overweight. Results of the multiple linear regression analysis revealed a significant association between BMI and cognitive  [MASK] (Beta=.10, p<.001).

      "[CLS] Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease characterized by the deposition of amyloid plaque in the brain. [MASK] autophagy-associated PIK3C3-containing phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns3K) complex has been shown to interfere with APP metabolism and amyloid beta peptide (Aß) homeostasis via poorly understood mechanisms. Here we report that NRBF2 (nuclear receptor binding factor 2), a key component and regulator of the PtdIns3K, is involved in APP-CTFs homeostasis in AD cell models. We found that NRBF2 interacts with APP in vivo and its expression levels are reduced in hippocampus of 5XFAD AD mice; we further demonstrated that NRBF2 overexpression promotes degradation of APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs), and reduces Aß1-40 and Aß1-42 levels in human mutant APP-overexpressing cells. Conversely, APP-CTFs, Aß1-40 and Aß1-42 levels were increased in Nrbf2 knockdown or nrbf2 knockout cells. Furthermore, NRBF2 positively regulates autophagy in neuronal cells and NRBF2-mediated reduction of  APP-CTFs levels is autophagy dependent. Importantly, nrbf2 knockout attenuates the recruitment of APP and APP-CTFs into phagophores and the sorting of APP and APP-CTFs into endosomal intralumenal vesicles, which is accompanied by the accumulation of the APP and APP-CTFs into RAB5-positive early endosomes. Collectively, our results reveal the potential connection between NRBF2 and the AD-associated protein APP by showing that NRBF2 plays an important role in regulating degradation of APP-CTFs through modulating autophagy.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Degradation of white matter microstructure has been demonstrated in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and Alzheimers disease (AD). In preparation for clinical trials, ongoing studies are investigating [MASK] utility of longitudinal brain imaging for quantification of disease progression. To date only one study has examined sample size calculations based on longitudinal changes in white matter integrity in FTLD. OBJECTIVE: To quantify longitudinal changes in white matter microstructural integrity in [MASK] three canonical subtypes of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and AD using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). METHODS: 60 patients with clinical diagnoses of FTD, including 27 with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), 14 with non-fluent variant primary progressive aphasia (nfvPPA), and 19 with semantic variant PPA (svPPA), as well as 19 patients with AD and 69 healthy controls were studied. We used a voxel-wise approach to calculate annual rate of change in fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) in each group using two time points approximately one year  apart. Mean rates of change in FA and MD in 48 atlas-based regions-of-interest, as well as global measures of cognitive function were used to calculate sample sizes for clinical trials (80% power, alpha of 5%). RESULTS: All FTD groups showed statistically significant baseline and longitudinal white matter degeneration, with predominant involvement of frontal tracts in [MASK] bvFTD group, frontal and temporal tracts in [MASK] PPA groups and posterior tracts in [MASK] AD group. Longitudinal change in MD yielded a larger number of regions with sample sizes below 100 participants per [MASK]rapeutic arm in comparison with FA. SvPPA had [MASK] smallest sample size based on change in MD in [MASK] fornix (n = 41 participants per study arm to detect a 40% effect of drug), and nfvPPA and AD had [MASK]ir smallest sample sizes based on rate of change in MD within [MASK] left superior longitudinal fasciculus (n = 49 for nfvPPA, and n = 23 for AD). BvFTD generally showed [MASK] largest sample size estimates (minimum n = 140 based on MD in [MASK] corpus callosum). The corpus callosum appeared to be [MASK] best region for a potential study that would include all FTD subtypes. Change in global measure of functional status (CDR box score) yielded [MASK] smallest sample size for bvFTD (n = 71), but clinical measures were inferior to white matter change for [MASK] o[MASK]r groups. CONCLUSIONS: All three of [MASK] canonical subtypes of FTD are associated with significant change in white matter integrity over one year. These changes are consistent enough that drug effects in future clinical trials could be detected with relatively small numbers of participants. While [MASK]re are some differences in regions of change across groups, [MASK] genu of [MASK] corpus callosum is a region that could be used to track progression in studies that include all subtypes.

      "[CLS] Interactions of Zn2+ with amyloid ß-protein (Aß) and the subsequent induction of  Aß aggregation have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimers disease (AD). The development of small-compound inhibitors against Zn2+-mediated Aß aggregation is therefore greatly desired. In this study, brazilin was used to inhibit Zn2+-mediated Aß aggregation and alleviate its cytotoxicity. The binding  properties of brazilin and Zn2+ were first probed using Fourier transform [MASK] (FTIR) spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) assays. Both the FTIR and ITC results have shown that brazilin is able to bind Zn2+ in a  physiologically suitable range of concentrations. The dissociation constant (Kd)  between brazilin and Zn2+ was about 46.0±6.8µM, which makes brazilin a potential  drug model for the chelation of free Zn2+. Moreover, the higher affinity of brazilin for Aß42 (Kd=2.5±1.6µM) than that of Zn2+ (Kd=6.2±0. 9µM), enables brazilin to sequester Zn2+ from the Aß42-Zn2+ complex. In addition, the inhibitory effects of brazilin on Zn2+-mediated Aß aggregation were examined using the Thioflavin T fluorescence assay, transmission electron microscopy and cytotoxicity assays. It was found that brazilin showed remarkable inhibitory capability against Zn2+-induced aggregation of Aß42. Furthermore, the Zn2+-mediated cytotoxicity of Aß42 was also largely mitigated under the influence of brazilin. This study therefore provides further insights into the role of Zn2+ in the Aß42 aggregation pathway, indicating potential new strategies for the design of small compounds with therapeutic potential for AD.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A developed method combining SPE and PRM-MS is employed to monitor the concentration of ubiquitin in CSF from subjects with Alzheimers disease (AD), Parkinsons disease (PD), and [MASK] supranuclear palsy (PSP). Four independent cross-sectional studies are conducted, studies 1-4, including controls (n = 86) and participants with AD (n = 60), PD (n = 15), and PSP (n = 11). RESULTS: The method shows a repeatability and intermediate precision not exceeding 6.1 and 7.9%, respectively. The determined LOD is 0.1 nm and the LOQ range between 0.625 and 80 nm. The CSF ubiquitin concentration is 1.2-1.5-fold higher in AD patients compared with controls in the three independent AD-control  studies (Study 1, p < 0.001; Study 2, p < 0.001; and Study 3, p = 0.003).

Methods: RO6958948, RO6931643, and RO6924963 were identified as high-affinity competitors at the 3H-T808 binding site on native tau aggregates in human late-stage AD brain [MASK]. Binding of tritiated compounds to brain [MASK] sections of AD patients and healthy controls was analyzed by macro- and microautoradiography and by costaining of tau aggregates and Aß plaques on the same [MASK] section using specific antibodies. All 3 tracer candidates were radiolabeled with a PET nuclide and tested in vivo in tau-naïve baboons to assess brain uptake, distribution, clearance, and metabolism. Results:3H-RO6958948, 3H-RO6931643, and 3H-RO6924963 bound with high affinity and specificity to tau aggregates, clearly lacking affinity for concomitant Aß plaques in human AD Braak V [MASK] sections. The specificity of all 3 radioligands for tau aggregates was supported, first, by binding patterns in AD sections comparable to the tau-specific radioligand 3H-T808; second, by very low nonspecific binding in brain [MASK] devoid of tau pathology, excluding significant radioligand binding to any other central nervous system target; and third, by macroscopic and microscopic colocalization and quantitative correlation of radioligand binding and tau antibody staining on the same [MASK] section.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP-2) regulates blood glucose levels, facilitates hippocampal synaptic plasticity and may have a predictive value for Alzheimers disease (AD) diagnosis. METHODS: IGFBP-2 levels were studied in plasma in 566 subjects and in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in 245 subjects across the AD spectrum from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Variants in the IGFBP-2 gene  were examined. Linear mixed modeling in SPSS tested main effects of IGFBP-2 and interactions with APOE4 on neurocognitive indices and biomarkers. Voxel-wise regression was used to gauge IGFBP-2 and regional grey matter and glucose metabolism associations. RESULTS: Each point increase in IGFBP-2 corresponded to a three times greater likelihood of having mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD. IGFBP-2 showed beneficial associations with respect to cognitive scores in individuals with two  APOE4 alleles. Higher IGFBP-2 predicted higher insulin resistance, but not CSF amyloid or tau. Voxel-wise analyses showed that plasma IGFBP-2 predicted lower grey matter volume and FDG metabolism in a large area spanning the [MASK] temporal, and occipital lobes. CSF IGFBP-2 levels showed similar voxel-wise analysis results, but were uniquely associated with CSF amyloid and tau. Analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IGFBP-2 showed that subjects carrying risk alleles versus common alleles had increased risk of AD and lower memory scores. Voxel-wise analyses of these SNPs also implicated the hippocampus  and prefrontal cortex. CONCLUSIONS: IGFBP-2 is associated with AD risk and outcomes; plasma IGFBP-2 provides stronger predictive power for brain outcomes, while CSF IGFBP-2 provides improved predictive accuracy for AD CSF biomarkers.

In this study, we investigated the distribution of Beclin 1 fragments  in neurons with AD-like injury. Our results demonstrated that Beclin 1 was expressed in neurons but not in astrocytes in both neuron-glia co-cultures and in cortical tissue slices. The full length and C-terminal fragments of human Beclin  1 was mainly expressed in cytoplasm, while the N-terminal fragment of Beclin 1 was predominantly localized in nucleus. Compared to amyloid-ß (Aß)42-1 treatment  control, exposure of PC12 cells or cortical neurons to Aß1-42 resulted in cell injury, with the appearance of neuritic shortening, reduced nuclear diameter in PC12 cells, beading formation and fragmentation in cortical neurons. A partial nuclear translocation of Beclin 1 was detected in cells incubated with Aß1-42, which could be inhibited by the administration of pan-Caspase inhibitor or Caspase 3 specific inhibitor. Moreover, Beclin 1 mutation at 146/149 sites was resistant to Aß1-42-induced nuclear translocation. The nuclear translocation of Beclin 1 could also been detected in the brains of 12-month-old APPSwe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice. Our findings suggest that after Caspase 3-mediated Beclin 1 cleavage at 146/149 sites, the N-terminal fragments of Beclin 1 may partially translocate into nuclei in neurons subjected to AD-like injury.

      "[CLS] Synapses are an early pathological target in many neurodegenerative diseases ranging from well-known adult onset conditions such as Alzheimer and Parkinson disease to neurodegenerative conditions of childhood such as spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCLs). However, the reasons why synapses are particularly vulnerable to such a broad range of neurodegeneration inducing stimuli remains unknown. To identify molecular modulators of synaptic stability and degeneration, we have used the Cln3 -/- mouse model of a juvenile form of NCL. We profiled and compared the molecular composition of anatomically-distinct, differentially-affected pre-synaptic populations from the  Cln3 -/- mouse brain using proteomics followed by bioinformatic analyses. Identified protein candidates were then tested using a Drosophila CLN3 model to study their ability to modify the CLN3-neurodegenerative phenotype in vivo. We identified differential perturbations in a range of molecular cascades correlating with synaptic vulnerability, including valine catabolism and rho signalling pathways. Genetic and pharmacological targeting of key hub proteins  in such pathways was sufficient to modulate phenotypic presentation in a Drosophila CLN3 model. We propose that such a workflow provides a target rich method for the [MASK] of novel disease regulators which could be applicable to the study of other conditions where appropriate models exist.

In spite [MASK] accumulating evidence that adiponectin has neuroprotective properties, the underlying role [MASK] adiponectin receptors has not been illuminated.

AdipoR1 knockdown mice exhibited increased body weight and abnormal  plasma chemistry and also showed spatial learning and memory impairment in behavioural studies. Moreover, AdipoR1 suppression resulted in neurodegenerative  phenotypes, diminished expression [MASK] the neuronal marker NeuN, and increased expression and activity [MASK] caspase 3. Furthermore, AD-like pathologies including  insulin signalling dysfunction, abnormal protein aggregation and neuroinflammatory responses were highly exhibited in AdipoR1 knockdown groups, consistent with brain pathologies in ADPN knockout mice.

CAA can occur in sporadic or rare hereditary forms, and is almost invariably associated with Alzheimers disease (AD). Experimental (animal) models are of great interest in studying mechanisms and potential treatments for CAA. Naturally occurring animal  models of CAA exist, including cats, dogs and non-human primates, which can be used for longitudinal studies. However, [MASK] to ethical considerations and low throughput of these models, other animal models are more favourable for research. In the past two decades, a variety of transgenic mouse models expressing the human Aß precursor protein (APP) has been developed.

Moreover, YKS-induced [MASK] were inhibited by the treatment with the TrkA receptor antagonist K252a (NGF+YKS 0.5+K252a group); no significant difference in neurite outgrowth was observed between K252a-treated (NGF+YKS 0.5+K252a group) and NGF-K252a-treated cells (NGF+K252a group). However, neurite outgrowth in K252a-treated cells (NGF+K252a and NGF+YKS 0.5+K252a group) reached only one-third of the level in NGF-treated cells (NGF group). NGF-mediated Akt phosphorylation increased by YKS was also inhibited by K252a treatment (NGF+YKS 0.5+K252a group), but no significant difference in ERK1/2 phosphorylation was observed between NGF-YKS-K252a- and NGF-treated cells (NGF group).

Neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), an example of tau-positive inclusions, are biochemically and morphologically distinguished from TDP-43-positive inclusions, and are one of the pathological core features of Alzheimer disease (AD). Although ALS/FTLD and AD are distinct clinical entities, they can coexist in an individual patient. Whether concurrence of ALS/FTLD-TDP-43 and AD-tau is incidental is still controversial, because aging is a common [MASK] factor for ALS/FTLD and AD development. Indeed, it remains unclear whether the pathogenesis of ALS/FTLD is a direct causal link to tau accumulation. Recent studies suggested that AD pathogenesis could cause the accumulation of TDP-43, while abnormal TDP-43 accumulation could also lead to abnormal tau expression. Overlapping presence of TDP-43 and tau, when observed in a brain during autopsy, should attract attention, and should initiate the search  for the pathological substrate for this abnormal protein accumulation. In addition to tau, other proteins including a-synuclein and amyloid ß should be also taken into account as candidates for an interaction with TDP-43.

      "[CLS] Background: Relationships between genetic risks for chronic diseases and long-run wellbeing are largely unexplored. We examined the associations between genetic predispositions to several chronic conditions and long-term functional health and socioeconomic status (SES). Methods: We used data on a nationally representative sample of 9,317 adults aged  65 years or older from the 1992 to 2012 Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) in the US. Survey data were linked to genetic data on nearly 2 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We measured individual-level genetic predispositions for coronary-artery disease, type 2 diabetes (T2D), obesity, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Alzheimers disease, and major depressive disorder (MDD) by polygenic risk  scores (PRS) derived from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The outcomes were self-rated health, depressive symptoms, cognitive ability, activities of everyday [MASK] educational attainment, and wealth. We employed regression analyses for the outcomes including all polygenic scores and adjusting for gender, birth period, and genetic ancestry. Results: The polygenic scores had important associations with functional health and SES. An increase in genetic risk for all conditions except T2D was significantly (p < .01) associated with reduced functional health and socioeconomic outcomes. The magnitudes of functional health declines were meaningful and in many cases equivalent in magnitude to several years of aging. These associations were robust to several sensitivity checks for ancestry and adjustment for parental educational attainment and age at death or the last interview if alive. Conclusion: Stronger genetic predispositions for leading chronic conditions are related to worse long-run health and SES outcomes, likely reflecting the adverse  effects of the onset of these conditions on ones wellbeing.

      "[CLS] Cyclic nucleotide PDEs are a super-family of enzymes responsible for regulating intracellular levels of the second messengers cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Through their catalysis, PDEs are able to exert tight regulation over these important intracellular signaling cascades. Previously, PDEs have been implicated in learning and memory, as well as in mood [MASK] such as anxiety and depression. PDE2 is of special interest due to its high level of expression in the forebrain, specifically in the isocortex, entorhinal cortex, striatum, hippocampus, amygdala, and medial habenula. Many of these brain regions are considered participants of the limbic system, which is known as the emotional regulatory center of the brain, and is important for modulating emotion and long-term memory. Therefore, PDE2s coincidental expression in these areas suggests an important role for PDE2 in these behaviors, and researchers are continuing to uncover the complex connections. It was shown that PDE2 inhibitors have pro-cognitive effects in tests of memory, including the object recognition test. PDE2 inhibitors are also  protective against cognitive deficits in various models of cognitive impairment.

Currently, the predominant theory for AD is the \"amyloid hypothesis,\" which states that abnormally increased levels of amyloid ß (Aß) peptides result in the production of a variety of aggregates that are neurotoxic. The specific mechanisms for Aß peptide-induced cytotoxicity have not yet been completely elucidated. However, since the majority of Aß is released into the extracellular milieu, it is reasonable to assume that  toxicity begins outside the cells and makes its way inside where it disrupts the  basic cellular process resulting in cell death.

We investigated biomarker distribution in those identified as subjective cognitive decline (SCD), amnestic (aMCI), and nonamnestic (naMCI) mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subtypes. In addition, the clinical groups were compared with controls on downstream neuroimaging markers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-ß42 (A ß42) and total tau (t-tau), phosphorylated tau (p-tau), fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), positron-emission tomography (PET), and MRI neuroimaging measures were collected  from 116 memory clinic patients. They were characterized as SCD, aMCI, and naMCI  according to comprehensive neuropsychological criteria. ANOVAs were used to assess differences when biomarkers were treated as continuous variables and chi square analyses were used to assess group differences in distribution of biomarkers. RESULTS: We did not find any between group differences in Aß42, nor in p-tau, but we [MASK] elevated t-tau in aMCI and SCD relative to the naMCI group. Significantly lower cortical glucose metabolism (as measured by FDG PET) was found in aMCI relative to SCD and controls, and there was a trend for lower metabolism in naMCI. Significant thinner entorhinal cortex (ERC) was found in aMCI and SCD. As expected biomarkers were significantly more frequently pathological in aMCI than in naMCI and SCD, whereas the naMCI and SCD groups displayed similar pathological biomarker burden. CONCLUSIONS: aMCI cases show the most pathologic biomarker burden. Interestingly  naMCI and SCD subjects show similar levels of pathological biomarkers albeit the  former displayed neuropsychological deficits.

Occasionally, outcomes were obtained via medical records. Accounting for informative censoring  due to death within a competing risks framework, Cox regression examined the associations of baseline MCAS performance with the start of (a) institutionalization and (b) homecare/institutionalization. RESULTS: Hazard ratios (HR) captured the effect of a ten-point difference in baseline MCAS scores, corresponding to a change from the MCI/HC to AD/MCI boundaries. In unadjusted models, increased baseline cognitive impairment was associated with nearly two-fold increases in the hazard of institutionalization (HR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.32, 2.48) and homecare/institutionalization (HR = 1.87, 95% CI = 1.44, 2.42).

      "[CLS] Pathology of Alzheimers disease (AD) goes far beyond neurotoxicity resulting from extracellular deposition of amyloid ß (Aß) plaques. Aberrant cleavage of amyloid precursor protein and accumulation of Aß in the form of the plaque or neurofibrillary tangles are the known primary culprits of AD pathogenesis and target for various regulatory mechanisms. Hyper-phosphorylation of tau, a major component of neurofibrillary tangles, precipitates its aggregation and prevents its clearance. Lipid particles, apolipoproteins and lipoprotein receptors can act in favor or against Aß and tau accumulation by altering neural membrane characteristics or dynamics of transport across the blood-brain barrier. Lipids also alter the oxidative/anti-oxidative milieu of the central nervous system (CNS). Irregular cell cycle regulation, mitochondrial stress and apoptosis, which follow both, are also implicated in AD-related neuronal loss. Dysfunction in synaptic transmission and loss of neural plasticity contribute to AD.

We performed literature search through PubMed and Scopus using the search term: (Alzheimer Disease) OR (Alzheimers Disease) AND (microRNAs OR miRNA OR MiR) to reach for relevant articles. We show how a limited number of common dysregulated pathways and abnormal mechanisms are affected by various types of miRNAs in AD brain. [SEP]\t\ttrail\n",

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Alzheimers disease (AD) is currently incurable and a majority of investigational drugs have failed clinical trials. One explanation for this failure may be the invalidity of hypotheses focusing on amyloid to explain AD pathogenesis. Recently, hypotheses which are centered on synaptic and metabolic dysfunction are increasingly implicated in AD. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate AD hypotheses by comparing neurotransmitter and metabolite marker concentrations in normal versus AD CSF. METHODS: Meta-analysis allows for statistical comparison of pooled, existing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) marker data extracted from multiple publications, to obtain a more reliable estimate of concentrations. This method also provides a unique opportunity to rapidly validate AD hypotheses using the resulting CSF concentration data. Hubmed, Pubmed and Google Scholar were comprehensively searched for published English articles, without date restrictions, for the keywords \"AD\", \"CSF\", and \"human\" plus markers selected for synaptic and metabolic pathways. Synaptic markers were acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid  (GABA), glutamine, and glycine. Metabolic markers were glutathione, glucose, [MASK] pyruvate, and 8 other amino acids. Only studies that measured markers in AD and controls (Ctl), provided means, standard errors/deviation, and subject numbers were included. Data were extracted by six authors and reviewed by two others for accuracy. Data were pooled using ratio of means (RoM of AD/Ctl) and random effects meta-analysis using Cochrane Collaborations Review Manager software. RESULTS: Of the 435 identified publications, after exclusion and removal of duplicates, 35 articles were included comprising a total of 605 AD patients and 585 controls. The following markers of synaptic and metabolic pathways were significantly changed in AD/controls: acetylcholine (RoM 0.36, 95% CI 0.24-0.53,  p<0.00001), GABA (0.74, 0.58-0.94, p<0.01), pyruvate (0.48, 0.24-0.94, p=0.03), glutathione (1.11, 1.01- 1.21, p=0.03), alanine (1.10, 0.98-1.23, p=0.09), and lower levels of significance for lactate (1.2, 1.00-1.47, p=0.05). Of note, CSF glucose and glutamate levels in AD were not significantly different than that of  the controls. CONCLUSION: This study provides proof of concept for the use of meta-analysis validation of AD hypotheses, specifically via robust evidence for the cholinergic hypothesis of AD. Our data disagree with the other synaptic hypotheses of glutamate excitotoxicity and GABAergic resistance to neurodegeneration, given observed unchanged glutamate levels and decreased GABA levels. With regards to metabolic hypotheses, the data supported upregulation of anaerobic glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway (glutathione), and anaplerosis of the tricarboxylic acid cycle using glutamate. Future applications of meta-analysis indicate the possibility of further in silico evaluation and generation of novel hypotheses in the AD field. [SEP]\t\tlactate,\n",

Participants were subsequently followed up for incident dementia, determined according to the DSM-III-R criteria, until January 1, 2015.

RESULTS: Our study population had a mean age of 64.9 years and 56.6% were women.  During a median follow-up of 7.8 years, 823 participants were diagnosed with all-cause dementia. Both low serum magnesium levels (=0.79 mmol/L) and high serum magnesium levels (=0.90 mmol/L) were associated with an increased risk of dementia (hazard ratio [HR] 1.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.69, and HR  1.30, 95% CI 1.02-1.67, respectively).

This index assesses information from medical records on indication, evaluation, dosage, drug-drug interactions, drug-disease interactions, duplications, [MASK] therapy duration. Various measurements were carried out to identify the possible patient [MASK] non-patient factors. Linear multilevel regression analysis was used to identify factors that are associated with APID index sum scores. Analyses were performed for groups of PDs separately, i.e. antipsychotics, antidepressants, anxiolytics,  [MASK] hypnotics. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 338 patients with a PD prescription that used 147 antipsychotics, 167 antidepressants, 85 anxiolytics, [MASK] 76 hypnotics. It was found that older patients [MASK] more severe aggression, agitation, apathy, [MASK] depression were associated with more appropriate prescriptions. Additionally, less appropriate prescriptions were found to be associated with more severe anxiety, dementia diagnoses other than Alzheimer dementia, more physician time available per patient, more patients per physician, more years of experience of the physician, [MASK] higher nurses workload. CONCLUSIONS: The association of more pronounced NPS with more appropriate PD prescriptions implies that physicians should pay more attention to the appropriateness of PD prescriptions when NPS are less manifest. Non-patient-related factors are also associated with the appropriateness of PD prescriptions.

For the [MASK] treatment of AD, traditional Chinese medicine are particularly suitable for drug discovery. In this review, we sum up six traditional Chinese medicinal herbs concerned with development of AChEIs, including Herba Epimedii, Coptis Chinensis Franch, Rhizoma Curcumae Longae, Green tea, Ganoderma, Panax Ginseng. The listed compounds based  on these herbs are belonging to six classes Flavonoids, Alkaloids, Ketones, Polyphenols, Terpenoid and Saponins, respectively.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: To validate a short cognitive test: the Test Your Memory [MASK] Mild Cognitive Impairment (TYM-MCI) in the diagnosis of patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment or mild Alzheimers disease (aMCI/AD). METHODS: Two hundred and two patients with mild memory problems were recruited. All had passed the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Patients completed the TYM-MCI, the Test Your Memory test (TYM), MMSE and revised Addenbrookes Cognitive Examination (ACE-R), had a neurological examination, clinical diagnostics and multidisciplinary team review. RESULTS: As a single test, the TYM-MCI per[MASK]med as well as the ACE-R in the distinction of patients with aMCI/AD from patients with subjective memory impairment with a sensitivity of 0.79 and specificity of 0.91. Used in combination with the ACE-R, it provided additional value and identified almost all cases of aMCI/AD. The TYM-MCI correctly classified most patients who had equivocal ACE-R scores. Integrated discriminant improvement analysis showed that  the TYM-MCI added value to the conventional memory assessment. Patients initially diagnosed as unknown or with subjective memory impairment who were later rediagnosed with aMCI/AD scored poorly on their original TYM-MCI. CONCLUSION: The TYM-MCI is a powerful short cognitive test that examines verbal and visual recall and is a valuable addition to the assessment of patients with aMCI/AD. It is simple and cheap to administer and requires minimal staff time and training. [SEP]\t\tfor\n",

      "[CLS] Brain capillary endothelial cells form the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which is covered with basement membranes and is also surrounded by pericytes and astrocyte end-feet in the neurovascular unit. The BBB tightly regulates the [MASK] exchange between the blood flow and brain parenchyma, thereby regulating the homeostasis of the central nervous system (CNS). Thus, dysfunction of the BBB is  likely involved in the pathogenesis of several neurological diseases, including Alzheimers disease (AD). While amyloid-ß (Aß) deposition and neurofibrillary tangle formation in the brain are central pathological hallmarks in AD, cerebrovascular lesions and BBB alteration have also been shown to frequently coexist. Although further clinical studies should clarify whether BBB disruption  is a specific feature of AD pathogenesis, increasing evidence indicates that each component of the neurovascular unit is significantly affected in the presence of  AD-related pathologies in animal models and human patients. Conversely, since some portions of Aß are eliminated along the neurovascular unit and across the BBB, disturbing the pathways may result in exacerbated Aß accumulation in the brain. Thus, current evidence suggests that BBB dysfunction may causatively and consequently contribute to AD pathogenesis, forming a vicious cycle between brain Aß accumulation and neurovascular unit impairments during disease progression.

Disappointing results from clinical trials performed in mild-moderate AD dementia combined with clear epidemiological evidence on AD risk factors are contributing to the development of primary prevention initiatives. In addition, the characterization of the long asymptomatic stage of AD is allowing the development of intervention studies and secondary prevention programmes on asymptomatic at-risk individuals, before substantial irreversible neuronal dysfunction and loss have occurred, an approach that emerges as highly relevant.In this manuscript, we review current strategies for AD prevention, from primary prevention strategies based on identifying risk factors and risk reduction, to secondary prevention initiatives based on the early detection of the pathophysiological hallmarks and intervention at the preclinical stage of the [MASK]. Firstly, we summarize the evidence on several AD risk factors, which are the rationale for the establishment of primary prevention programmes as well as revising current primary prevention strategies. Secondly, we review the development of public-private partnerships for [MASK] prevention that aim to characterize the AD continuum as well as serving as platforms for secondary prevention trials.

      "[CLS] The recent generation of induced neurons by direct lineage conversion holds promise for in vitro modelling of sporadic Alzheimers disease. Here, we report the generation of induced neuron-based model of sporadic Alzheimers disease in mice and humans, and used this system to explore the pathogenic mechanisms resulting from the sporadic Alzheimers disease risk factor apolipoprotein E (APOE) [MASK] allele. We show that mouse and human induced neurons overexpressing mutant amyloid precursor protein in the background of APOE [MASK] allele exhibit altered amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing, abnormally increased production of amyloid-ß42 and hyperphosphorylation of tau. Importantly, we demonstrate that APOE [MASK] patient induced neuron culture models can faithfully recapitulate molecular signatures seen in APOE [MASK]-associated sporadic Alzheimers disease patients. Moreover, analysis of the gene network derived from APOE [MASK] patient induced neurons reveals a strong interaction between APOE [MASK]  and another Alzheimers disease risk factor, desmoglein 2 (DSG2). Knockdown of DSG2 in APOE [MASK] induced neurons effectively rescued defective APP processing, demonstrating the functional importance of this interaction.

      "[CLS] Patients suffering from rare, extreme or extremely complex sets of symptoms have  something to expect from efforts to improve care through research. Biomedical research and care have often been approached as distinct worlds which are and should be only loosely connected. For observational research focusing on data drawn from real-world settings, however, that approach is found wanting. Integrating research and care responsibly is the main challenge instead. Integrated IT infrastructures facilitating Personalized medicine and Big Data are crucial components of a learning health care system, in which patients regularly  play a double role: as individuals to be treated and as cases to learn from. Drawing on the example of the Dutch Parelsnoer Institute (PSI), a national biobanking and IT infrastructure integrated with clinical care procedures, this article outlines the reforms that are needed. Systematic integration of research  and care offers a promising avenue, provided that a number of conditions are met: data and IT infrastructures will require overhauls in order to facilitate secure, high-quality data integration between research and care; institutional focus is needed to bring patient populations and expertise together; ethical frameworks and approaches for integrating research and care responsibly require further elaboration; clinical procedures and professional [MASK] may need to be adapted in order to accommodate research requirements in clinical processes; and  involvement of patients and other stakeholders in design and research priority setting is needed to further the goals of real-world and patient relevance.Relevance for patients: Integrating research and care in academic medicine in a more systematic fashion offers a promising perspective to current and future patients. In order to live up to these promises, research and care should be integrated more systematically in academic health science, with patients being included as research participants by default. Data and tissue infrastructures and facilities can provide a platform for doing so. At the same time, many issues remain to be settled. New ethical ways and means for protecting and respecting patient-participants in such a double role are also needed in this respect. In this way a deeper transformation is at stake as well: a change towards a setting in which patients fully take center stage in debate and action  on the future of biomedicine.

      "[CLS] Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder. Along with an increasing number of elderly worldwide, it poses a great challenge for the society and health care. Although sporadic AD is the common form of AD, 2-3%  of the AD cases are expected to be due to mutations in the [MASK] region of the amyloid precursor protein, which is referred to as autosomal dominant AD (ADAD).  These mutations may cause changes in the secondary structure of the amyloid [MASK] fibrils and may alter the fibrillization rate leading to changes in the disease development and could also affect the binding to tracers used in diagnosis. In particular, from some recent clinical studies using PET tracers for detection of  fibrillar amyloids, it is evident that in ADAD patients with Arctic mutation no amyloid plaque binding can be detected with the 11C-Pittsburgh Compound B (11C-PIB). However, for in vitro conditions, significant binding of 3H-PIB has been reported for the amyloid fibrils carrying the Arctic mutation. The aim of the present study is to investigate if there is any mutation specific binding of  commonly used amyloid tracers, namely, florbetaben, florbetapir, FPIB, AZD4694, and AZD2184, by means of molecular modeling techniques. Other than Arctic, ADAD mutations, such as the Dutch, Italian, Iowa, and Flemish mutations, are considered in this study. We report that all tracers except florbetapir show reduced binding affinity toward amyloid [MASK] fibrils with the Arctic mutation when compared to the native type. Moreover, florbetapir is the only tracer that binds  to all mutants with increased affinity when compared to the native fibril. The results obtained from these studies could increase the understanding of the structural changes caused by mutation and concomitant changes in the interaction  pattern of the PET tracers with the mutated variants, which in turn can be useful in selecting the appropriate tracers for the purpose of diagnosis as well as for  designing new tracers with desirable properties.

      "[CLS] OBJECTIVES: To review evidence of hearing loss as a risk factor for dementia. Data Sources: PubMed Review methods: A systematic review was conducted using the  PubMed database using the search terms (hearing loss OR presbycusis) AND (dementia OR cognitive decline). Initially, 488 articles were obtained. Only those studies evaluating an association between hearing loss and incident dementia or cognitive decline were included in the analysis. This resulted in 17  articles which were thoroughly evaluated with consideration for study design, method for determining hearing loss and cognitive status, relevant covariates and confounding factors, and key findings. RESULTS: All of the 17 articles meeting inclusion criteria indicate that hearing  loss is associated with dementia or cognitive decline. The methods used among the studies for ascertaining hearing loss and dementia were notably varied. For hearing loss, peripheral auditory function was tested far more than central auditory function. For peripheral audition, pure tone audiometry was the most commonly reported method for defining hearing loss. Only a few studies measured central auditory function by using the Synthetic Sentence Identification with Ipsilateral Competing Message test (SSI-ICM) and the Staggered Spondaic Word Test (SSW). Dementia was most often defined using the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE). However, many studies used extensive batteries of tests to define cognitive status, often including a neuropsychologist. Confounding variables such as cardiovascular risk factors were measured in 17 studies and family history of dementia was only evaluated in 1 study. Overall, the methods used by studies to ascertain hearing loss, cognitive status and other variables are valid, making their evaluation appear reliable. CONCLUSION: While each of the studies included in this study utilized slightly different methods for evaluating participants, each of them demonstrated that hearing loss is associated with higher incidence of dementia in older adults.

AD is clinically characterized by progressive dementia and neuropathologically by neuronal and synapse loss, accumulation of amyloid plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in specific brain regions. The preclinical or presymptomatic stage of AD-related brain changes [MASK] begin over 20 years before symptoms occur, making development of noninvasive biomarkers essential. Distinct from neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, plasma or serum biomarkers can be analyzed to assess (i) the presence/absence of AD, (ii) the risk of developing AD, (iii) the  progression of AD, or (iv) AD response to treatment.

      "[CLS] Alzheimers disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative disorder which is considered to be the most common cause of dementia. It has a greater impact not only on the learning and memory disturbances but also on social and economy. Currently, there are mainly single-target drugs for AD treatment but the complexity and multiple etiologies of AD make them difficult to obtain desirable therapeutic effects. Therefore, the choice of multi-target drugs will be a potential effective strategy inAD treatment. To find multi-target active ingredients for AD treatment from Selaginella plants, we firstly explored  the behaviors effects on AD mice of total extracts (TE) from Selaginella doederleinii on by Morris water maze test and found that TE has a remarkable improvement on learning and memory function for AD mice. And then, multi-target SAR models associated with AD-related proteins were built based on Random Forest  (RF) and different descriptors to preliminarily screen potential active ingredients from Selaginella. Considering the prediction outputs and the quantity of existing compounds in our laboratory, 13 compounds were chosen to carry out the in vitro enzyme inhibitory experiments and 4 compounds with BACE1/MAO-B dual  inhibitory activity were determined. Finally, the [MASK] docking was applied to verify the prediction results and enzyme inhibitory experiments. Based on these study and validation processes, we explored a new strategy to improve the efficiency of active ingredients screening based on trace amount of natural product and numbers of targets and found some multi-target compounds with biological activity for the development of novel drugs for AD treatment.

In mid-life, there is a strong association between obesity and impaired cognitive function. Anthropometric measures of obesity are also associated with reduced neural integrity (e.g. grey and white matter atrophy). Increasing age coupled with the negative metabolic consequences of obesity (e.g. type 2 diabetes mellitus) are likely to significantly contribute to cognitive [MASK] and incidence of dementia.

      "[CLS] Huntingtons disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease resulting in motor impairment and death in patients. Recently, several studies have demonstrated insulin or insulin-like growth factor (IGF) treatment in models of HD, resulting in potent amelioration of HD phenotypes via modulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways. Administration of IGF and insulin can rescue microtubule  transport, metabolic function, and autophagy defects, resulting in clearance of Huntingtin (HTT) aggregates, restoration of mitochondrial function, amelioration  of motor abnormalities, and enhanced survival. Manganese (Mn) is an essential metal to all biological systems but, in excess, can be toxic. Interestingly, several studies have revealed the insulin-mimetic effects of Mn-demonstrating Mn  can activate several of the same metabolic kinases and increase peripheral and neuronal insulin and [MASK] levels in rodent models. Separate studies have shown mouse and human striatal neuroprogenitor cell (NPC) models exhibit a deficit in cellular Mn uptake, indicative of a Mn deficiency. Furthermore, evidence from the literature reveals a striking overlap between cellular consequences of Mn deficiency (i.e., impaired function of Mn-dependent enzymes) and known HD endophenotypes including excitotoxicity, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS)  accumulation, and decreased mitochondrial function. Here we review published evidence supporting a hypothesis that (1) the potent effect of IGF or insulin treatment on HD models, (2) the insulin-mimetic effects of Mn, and (3) the newly  discovered Mn-dependent perturbations in HD may all be functionally related. Together, this review will present the intriguing possibility that intricate regulatory cross-talk exists between Mn biology and/or toxicology and the insulin/IGF signaling pathways which may be deeply connected to HD pathology and, perhaps, other neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) and other neuropathological conditions.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: The molecular mechanism underlying progressive memory loss in Alzheimers disease is poorly understood. Neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus is a dynamic process that continuously changes the dentate gyrus and is important for hippocampal plasticity, learning and memory. However, whether impairments in  neurogenesis affect the hippocampal circuitry in a way that leads to memory deficits characteristic of Alzheimers disease is unknown. Controversial results  in that regard were reported in transgenic mouse models of amyloidosis. METHODS: Here, we conditionally ablated adult neurogenesis in APPswe/PS1?E9 mice  by crossing these with mice expressing nestin-driven thymidine kinase (d-HSV-TK). RESULTS: These animals show impairment in performance in contextual conditioning  and pattern separation tasks [MASK] depletion of neurogenesis. Importantly, these deficits were not observed in age-matched APPswe/PS1?E9 or d-HSV-TK mice alone. Furthermore, we show that cognitive deficits were accompanied by the upregulation of hyperphosphorylated tau in the hippocampus and in immature neurons specifically. Interestingly, we observed upregulation of the immediate early gene Zif268 (Egr-1) in the dentate gyrus, CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus [MASK] learning in the neurogenesis-depleted d-HSV-TK mice. This may suggest overactivation of hippocampal neurons in these areas [MASK] depletion of neurogenesis.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Vision-based measures have been shown to be useful markers in multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer and Parkinson disease. Therefore, these testing paradigms may have applications to populations explaining repetitive head trauma that has been associated with long-term neurodegenerative sequelae. We investigated retinal structure and visual function in professional collision sport athletes compared to age- and race-matched control participants. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, participants underwent spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) measurements of peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and macular ganglion cell complex (GCC = ganglion cell + inner plexiform layers) thickness. High-contrast visual acuity (100% level), low-contrast letter acuity (LCLA) (1.25% and 2.5% levels), and King-Devick Test of rapid [MASK] naming performance were administered. Vision-specific quality of  life (QOL) measures were assessed. RESULTS: Among 46 collision sport athletes (boxing, n = 14; football, n = 29; ice hockey, n = 3) and 104 control participants, average RNFL thickness was a significant predictor of athlete vs control status with athletes demonstrating 4.8-µm of thinning compared to controls (P = 0.01, generalized estimating equation [GEE] models accounting for age and within-subject, intereye correlations). Athlete vs control status was not a predictor of RNFL thickness for the subgroup of football players in this cohort (P = 0.60). Binocular (P = 0.001) and monocular (P = 0.02) LCLA at 2.5% contrast and vision-specific QOL (P  = 0.04) were significant predictors of athlete vs control status (GEE models accounting for age and within-subject, intereye correlations). Rapid [MASK] naming performance times were not significantly different between the control and athlete groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that retinal axonal and neuronal loss is present among collision sport athletes, with most notable differences seen in boxers. These findings are accompanied by reductions in visual function and QOL, similar  to patterns observed in multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases. Vision-based changes associated with head trauma exposure that have the potential to be detected in vivo represent a unique opportunity for further study to determine if these changes in collision sport athletes are predictive of future neurodegeneration.

      "[CLS] Alzheimers Disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and to date there is no cure or efficient prophylaxis. The cognitive decline correlates with the accumulation of amyloid-ß (Aß) in the walls of capillaries and arteries.

With advancing age and arteriosclerosis, the stiffness of arterial walls, this pathway fails in its function and Aß accumulates in the walls of arteries. In this study we tested the hypothesis that arterial [MASK] drive IPAD and that a valve mechanism ensures the net drainage in a direction opposite to that of the blood flow. This hypothesis was tested using a mathematical model of the drainage mechanism. We demonstrate firstly that arterial [MASK] are not strong enough to produce drainage velocities comparable to experimental observations.

      "[CLS] Oligomeric Amyloid ß1-42 (Aß) plays a crucial synaptotoxic role in Alzheimers disease, and hyperphosphorylated tau facilitates Aß toxicity. The link between Aß and tau, however, remains controversial. In this study, we find that in hippocampal neurons, Aß acutely induces tubulin posttranslational modifications (PTMs) and stabilizes dynamic microtubules (MTs) by reducing their catastrophe frequency. Silencing or acute [MASK] of the formin mDia1 suppresses these activities and corrects the synaptotoxicity and deficits of axonal transport induced by Aß.

      "[CLS] The pathology of Alzheimers disease (AD) is characterized by dystrophic neurites (DNs) surrounding extracellular Aß-plaques, microgliosis, astrogliosis, intraneuronal tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation. We have previously shown  that inhibition of the spleen tyrosine kinase ([MASK]) lowers Aß production and tau  hyperphosphorylation in vitro and in vivo. Here, we demonstrate that Aß-overexpressing Tg PS1/APPsw, Tg APPsw mice, and tau overexpressing Tg Tau P301S mice exhibit a pathological activation of [MASK] compared to wild-type littermates. [MASK] activation is occurring in a subset of microglia and is age-dependently increased in Aß-plaque-associated dystrophic neurites of Tg PS1/APPsw and Tg APPsw mice. In Tg Tau P301S mice, a pure model of tauopathy, activated [MASK] occurs in neurons that show an accumulation of misfolded and hyperphosphorylated tau in the cortex and hippocampus. Interestingly, the tau pathology is exacerbated in neurons that display high levels of [MASK] activation supporting a role of [MASK] in the formation of tau pathological species in vivo. Importantly, human AD brain sections show both pathological [MASK] activation in DNs around Aß deposits and in neurons immunopositive for pathological tau species recapitulating the data obtained in transgenic mouse models of AD. Additionally,  we show that [MASK] overexpression leads to increased tau accumulation and promotes  tau hyperphosphorylation at multiple epitopes in human neuron-like SH-SY5Y cells, further supporting a role of [MASK] in the formation of tau pathogenic species. Collectively, our data show that [MASK] activation occurs following Aß deposition and the formation of tau pathological species. Given that we have previously shown that [MASK] activation also promotes Aß formation and tau hyperphosphorylation, our data suggest that AD pathological lesions may be self-propagating via a [MASK] dependent mechanism highlighting [MASK] as an attractive  therapeutic target for the treatment of AD.

The necessity for an accurate, but at the  same time, inexpensive and minimally invasive, diagnostic test is urgently required, not only to confirm the presence of the disease but also to discriminate between different types of dementia to provide the appropriate management and treatment. In this study, attenuated total reflection FTIR (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy combined with chemometric techniques were used to analyze blood plasma samples from our cohort. Blood samples are easily collected by conventional venepuncture, permitting repeated measurements from the same individuals to monitor their progression throughout the years or evaluate any tested drugs. We included 549 individuals: 347 with various neurodegenerative diseases and 202 age-matched healthy individuals. Alzheimers disease (AD; n = 164) was identified with [MASK] sensitivity and specificity, which after the incorporation of apolipoprotein e4 genotype (APOE e4) information, increased to 86% when individuals carried one or two alleles of e4, and to 72% sensitivity and 77% specificity when individuals did not carry e4 alleles. Early AD cases (n = 14) were identified with 80% sensitivity and 74% specificity. Segregation of AD from dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB; n = 34) was achieved with 90% sensitivity and specificity.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to develop neuropsychological markers  supposed to reflect insular dysfunction, which would facilitate early diagnosis of [MASK], namely in comparison to AD. METHODS: Twelve patients with [MASK], 12 patients with AD, all at the stage of Mild  cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild dementia, as well as 10 Controls subjects (CS) participated in the study. Cognitive functions supposedly related to the insula were evaluated with a battery of tests: a facial expression recognition test, a test assessing the feeling of disgust with images, a test evaluating idioms comprehension, an empathy questionnaire and a questionnaire screening for disgusting behaviors. RESULTS: Compared to AD patients and CS, [MASK] patients experienced less disgust when they were shown disgusting images, whereas their ability to recognize emotional expression of disgust appeared to be preserved. Furthermore, [MASK] patients seemed less empathetic than AD patients. Finally, compared to CS, [MASK] patients were less effective to provide an intuitive decision about idioms signification since they needed significantly more time to answer.

      "[CLS] OBJECTIVES: To quantitatively review the literature comparing depressed mood, anxiety and psychological distress in caregivers (CGs) of older adults with Alzheimers disease (AD) with non-caregivers (NCGs) Methods: Eighteen independent studies comparing AD CGs (N = 2378) with NCGs (N = 70,035) were evaluated in accordance with the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines. Standardised mean differences (Hedges g) with  associated 95% confidence intervals and p-values were calculated using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Studies generally conformed to STROBE criteria in terms of their methodological and procedural detail, although data management issues that may contribute to methodological bias were identified. Pooled effect estimates revealed medium to large [MASK] differences in depression (gw = 1.01 [CI: 0.73, 1.29] p < 0.01) and anxiety (gw = 0.64 [CI: 0.39, 0.89] p < 0.01): AD caregivers  reported higher symptom severity. Gender was a significant moderator: female caregivers experienced poor self-reported mood (gw = 1.58 [CI: 1.11, 2.05], p < 0.01), although this analysis was limited in power given the small number of contributing studies. DISCUSSION: Caregivers of patients with AD experience poor mental health in comparison to the general population, with female caregivers being disproportionately affected. Further exploration of the psychosocial variables that contribute to these [MASK] differences is needed to inform effective support  services and, in turn, help caregivers manage the emotional demands of AD.

This study is aimed to determine whether quantification of plasma tau  phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau181) is informative in the diagnosis of AD. METHODS: We have developed a novel ultrasensitive immunoassay to quantify plasma  p-tau181, and measured the levels of plasma p-tau181 in three cohorts. RESULTS: In the first cohort composed of 20 AD patients and 15 age-matched controls, the plasma levels of p-tau181 were significantly higher in the AD patients than those in the controls (0.171 ± 0.166 pg/ml in AD versus 0.0405 ± 0.0756 pg/ml in controls, p = 0.0039). The percentage of the subjects whose levels of plasma p-tau181 exceeded the cut-off value (0.0921 pg/ml) was significantly higher in the AD group compared with the control group (60% in AD versus 16.7% in controls, p = 0.0090). In the second cohort composed of 20 patients with Down syndrome (DS) and 22 age-matched controls, the plasma concentrations of p-tau181 were significantly higher in the DS group (0.767 ± 1.26 pg/ml in DS versus 0.0415 ± 0.0710 pg/ml in controls, p = 0.0313).  There was a significant correlation between the plasma levels of p-tau181 and age in the DS group (R2 = 0.4451, p = 0.0013). All of the DS individuals showing an extremely high concentration of plasma p-tau181 (> 1.0 pg/ml) were older than the age of 40. In the third cohort composed of 8 AD patients and 3 patients with other neurological diseases, the levels of plasma p-tau181 significantly correlated with those of CSF p-tau181 (R2 = 0.4525, [MASK] CONCLUSIONS: We report for the first time quantitative data on the plasma levels  of p-tau181 in controls and patients with AD and DS, and these data suggest that  the plasma p-tau181 is a promising blood biomarker for brain AD pathology.

      "[CLS] Oxidative stress is a pathological hallmark of neurodegenerative tauopathic disorders such as Alzheimers disease [MASK] Parkinsons disease-related dementia, which are characterized by altered forms of the microtubule-associated protein (MAP) tau. MAP tau is a key protein in stabilizing the microtubule architecture that regulates neuron morphology [MASK] synaptic strength. When MAP tau is degraded  in tauopathic disorders, neuron dysfunction results. The precise role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the tauopathic disease process, however, is poorly understood. Classically, mitochondrial dysfunction has been viewed as the major source of oxidative stress [MASK] has been shown to precede tau [MASK] amyloid pathology in various dementias, but the exact mechanisms are not clear. It is known that the production of ROS by mitochondria can result in ultraweak photon emission (UPE) within cells. While of low intensity, surrounding proteins within  the cytosol can still absorb these energetic photons via aromatic amino acids (e.g., tryptophan [MASK] tyrosine). One likely absorber of these photons is the microtubule cytoskeleton, as it forms a vast network spanning neurons, is highly  co-localized with mitochondria, [MASK] shows a high density of aromatic amino acids. Functional microtubule networks may traffic this ROS-generated endogenous photon  energy for cellular signaling, or they may serve as dissipaters/conduits of such  energy to protect the cell from potentially harmful effects. Experimentally, after in vitro exposure to exogenous photons, microtubules have been shown to reorient [MASK] reorganize in a dose-dependent manner with the greatest effect being observed around 280nm, in the tryptophan [MASK] tyrosine absorption range. In this paper, recent modeling efforts based on ambient temperature experiment are presented, showing that tubulin polymers can feasibly absorb [MASK] channel these photoexcitations via resonance energy transfer, on the order of dendritic length  scales [MASK] neuronal fine structure. Since microtubule networks are compromised in tauopathic diseases such as Alzheimers [MASK] Parkinsons dementias, patients with  these illnesses would be unable to support effective channeling of these photons  for signaling or dissipation. Consequent emission surplus due to increased UPE production or decreased ability to absorb [MASK] transfer may lead to increased cellular oxidative damage, thus hastening the neurodegenerative process.

Four hundred and eleven healthy, community-dwelling older adults who were all born in 1936 were assessed on TMT-B, 5 tests of processing speed, and provided contemporaneous structural and diffusion MRI data. Significant relationships were found between slower TMT-B completion times and thinner cortex in the frontal, temporal and inferior parietal regions as well as the Sylvian fissure/insula. Slower TMT-B completion time was also significantly associated with poorer white matter microstructure of the left anterior thalamic radiation, and the right uncinate fasciculus.

      "[CLS] Mature excitatory synapses are composed of more than 1500 proteins postsynaptically and hundreds more that operate presynaptically. Among them, drebrin is an F-actin-binding protein that increases noticeably during juvenile synaptogenesis. Electron microscopic analysis reveals that drebrin is highly enriched specifically on the postsynaptic side of excitatory synapses. Since dendritic spines are structures specialized for excitatory synaptic transmission, the function of drebrin was probed by analyzing the ultrastructural characteristics of dendritic spines of animals with genetic deletion of drebrin A (DAKO), the adult isoform of drebrin. Electron microscopic analyses revealed that these brains are surprisingly intact, in that axo-spinous synaptic junctions are  well-formed and not significantly altered in number. This normal ultrastructure may be because drebrin E, the alternate embryonic isoform, compensates for the genetic deletion of drebrin A. However, DAKO results in the loss of homeostatic plasticity of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). The NMDAR activation-dependent trafficking of the NR2A subunit-containing NMDARs from dendritic shafts into spine head cytoplasm is greatly diminished within brains of DAKO. Conversely, within brains of wild-type rodents, spines respond to NMDAR blockade with influx of F-actin, drebrin A, and NR2A subunits of NMDARs. These observations indicate that drebrin A facilitates the trafficking of NMDAR cargos  in an F-actin-dependent manner to mediate homeostatic plasticity. Analysis of the brains of transgenic mice used as models of Alzheimers disease (AD) reveals that the loss of drebrin from dendritic spines predates the emergence of synaptic dysfunction and cognitive impairment, suggesting that this form of homeostatic plasticity contributes toward cognition. Two studies suggest that the nature of drebrins interaction with NMDARs is dependent on the receptors subunit composition. Drebrin A can be found co-clustering with NR2B-containing NMDARs at  the plasma membrane, while NR2A-containing NMDARs co-traffic into the spine cytoplasm but do not co-cluster at the plasma membrane. Most recently, we encountered a physiological condition that supports this idea. When adolescent female rats are reared under a condition of restricted food access and ad libitum wheel access, they paradoxically become excessive runners, choosing to run, even  during the limited hours of food availability. This behavioral pattern is termed  activity-based anorexia (ABA) and has served as an animal model for anorexia nervosa. Those animals that exhibit the greatest ABA vulnerability, in that they  lose the most amount of body weight and run with greatest exuberance to the point of risking their lives, exhibit the highest levels of NR2B-NMDARs and drebrin at  the postsynaptic membrane of hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Those animals that exhibit the greatest resilience to ABA, in that they run minimally under such condition, [MASK] losing minimal amount of weight, exhibit the highest level of  NR2A-NMDARs in the spine cytoplasm and lowest levels of drebrin at the postsynaptic membrane. This pattern suggests that drebrin has dual roles: retention of NR2A-NMDARs in the reserve pool and trafficking of NR2B-NMDARs to the postsynaptic membrane, ultimately contributing to an individuals reactivity  to stress. Altogether, these observations indicate that drebrin is a protein that is important for synaptic plasticity and deserves the attention of neuroscientists studying the neurobiological basis of cognition and stress reactivity.

      "[CLS] Osteopontin (OPN), a matricellular immunomodulatory cytokine highly expressed by  myelomonocytic cells, is known to regulate immune cell migration, communication,  and response to brain injury. Enhanced cerebral recruitment of monocytes achieved through glatiramer acetate (GA) immunization or peripheral blood enrichment with  bone marrow (BM)-derived CD115+ monocytes (MoBM) curbs amyloid ß-protein (Aß) neuropathology and preserves cognitive function in murine models of Alzheimers disease (ADtg mice). To elucidate the beneficial mechanisms of these immunomodulatory approaches in AD, we focused on the potential role of OPN in macrophage-mediated Aß clearance. Here, we found extensive OPN upregulation along with reduction of vascular and parenchymal Aß [MASK] in cortices and hippocampi of GA-immunized ADtg mice. Treatment combining GA with blood-grafted MoBM further increased OPN levels surrounding residual Aß plaques. In brains from AD patients  and ADtg mice, OPN was also elevated and predominantly expressed by infiltrating  GFP+- or Iba1+-CD45high monocyte-derived macrophages engulfing Aß plaques. Following GA immunization, we detected a significant increase in a subpopulation  of inflammatory blood monocytes (CD115+CD11b+Ly6Chigh) expressing OPN, and subsequently, an elevated population of OPN-expressing CD11b+Ly6C+CD45high monocyte/macrophages in the brains of these ADtg mice. Correlogram analyses indicate a strong linear correlation between cerebral OPN levels and macrophage infiltration, as well as a tight inverse relation between OPN and Aß-plaque [MASK]. In vitro studies corroborate in vivo findings by showing that GA directly upregulates OPN expression in BM-derived macrophages (M?BM). Further, OPN promotes a phenotypic shift that is highly phagocytic (increased uptake of Aß fibrils and surface scavenger receptors) and anti-inflammatory (altered cell morphology, reduced iNOS, and elevated IL-10 and Aß-degrading enzyme MMP-9). Inhibition of OPN expression in M?BM, either by siRNA, knockout (KOOPN), or minocycline, impairs uptake of Aß fibrils and hinders GAs neuroprotective effects on macrophage immunological profile. Addition of human recombinant OPN reverses the impaired Aß phagocytosis in KOOPN-M?BM.

      "[CLS] Sequence variations occurring in the gene encoding the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) support an essential function of [MASK] and innate immunity in the pathogenesis of Alzheimers disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative disorders. TREM2 matures within the secretory pathway, and its  ectodomain is shed on the plasma membrane. Missense mutations in the immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain such as p.T66M and p.Y38C retain TREM2 within the endoplasmic reticulum and reduce shedding as well as TREM2-dependent phagocytosis. Using mass spectrometry, we have now determined the cleavage site of TREM2. TREM2 is shed by proteases of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain containing protein) family C-terminal to histidine 157,  a position where an AD-associated coding variant has been discovered (p.H157Y) in the Han Chinese population. Opposite to the characterized mutations within the Ig-like domain, such as p.T66M and p.Y38C, the p.H157Y variant within the stalk region leads to enhanced shedding of TREM2. Elevated ectodomain shedding reduces  cell surface full-length TREM2 and lowers TREM2-dependent phagocytosis. Therefore, two seemingly opposite cellular effects of TREM2 variants, namely reduced versus enhanced shedding, result in similar phenotypic outcomes by reducing cell surface TREM2.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Use of mobile health (mHealth) apps is growing at an exponential rate in the United States and around the world. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer disease, and related dementias are a global health problem. Numerous mHealth interventions exist for this population, yet the effect of these interventions on health has not been systematically described. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to catalog the types of health outcomes used  to measure effectiveness of mHealth interventions and assess which mHealth interventions have been shown to improve the health of persons with MCI, Alzheimer disease, and dementia. METHODS: We searched 13 databases, including Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, the full Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Ei Compendex, IEEE Xplore, Applied Science & Technology Source, Scopus, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Google Scholar from inception through May 2017 for mHealth studies involving persons with cognitive impairment that were evaluated using at least one quantitative health outcome. Proceedings of the Annual ACM Conferences on Human Factors in Computing Systems, the ACM User Interface Software and Technology Symposium, and the IEEE International Symposium on Wearable Computers were searched in the ACM Digital Library from 2012 to 2016. A hand search of JMIR Publications journals was also completed in July 2017. RESULTS: After removal of duplicates, our initial search returned 3955 records. Of these articles, 24 met final inclusion criteria as studies involving mHealth interventions that measured at least one quantitative health outcome for persons  with MCI, Alzheimer disease, and dementia. Common quantitative health outcomes included cognition, function, mood, and quality of life. We found that 21.2% (101/476) of the fully reviewed articles were excluded because of a lack of health outcomes. The health outcomes selected were observed to be inconsistent between studies. For those studies with quantitative health outcomes, more than half (58%) reported postintervention improvements in outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Results showed that many mHealth app interventions targeting those with cognitive impairment lack quantitative health outcomes as a part of their [MASK] process and that there is a lack of consensus as to which outcomes to  use. The majority of mHealth app interventions that incorporated health outcomes  into their [MASK] noted improvements in the health of persons with MCI, Alzheimer disease, and dementia. However, these studies were of low quality, leading to a grade C level of evidence. Clarification of the benefits of mHealth  interventions for people with cognitive impairment requires more randomized controlled trials, larger numbers of participants, and trial designs that minimize bias.

      "[CLS] OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to develop a Danish adaptation of the Boston Naming Test (BNT) including a shortened 30-item version of the BNT for routine clinical use and two parallel 15-item versions for screening purposes. METHOD: The Danish adaptation of the BNT was based on ranking of items according  to difficulty in a sample of older non-patients (n = 99). By selecting those items with the largest discrepancy in difficulty for non-patients compared to a mild Alzheimers disease (AD) sample (n = 53), the shortened versions of the BNT  were developed. Using an overlapping cells approach preliminary education and age norms for older Danes were constructed. RESULTS: The Danish adaptation of the BNT had adequate reliability and the short  versions were all highly correlated with the full 60-item BNT (BNT-60). The sensitivity and specificity of the BNT-60 was .83 and .86, respectively. The shortened versions displayed some reduction in sensitivity (.70-.77) but similar  or better specificity (.86-.91). Post-test probabilities of mild AD associated with [MASK] along selected score ranges of the BNT were estimated. Likelihood ratios were presented that can be combined with information regarding  the base rate of AD in any setting in order to assist in interpreting the clinical significance of a given performance. CONCLUSION: The short Danish versions of the BNT were highly correlated with the  full BNT indicating that they measure the same construct. The Danish versions had acceptable diagnostic accuracy discriminating between mild AD and older non-patients. [SEP]\t\tperformances\n",

      "[CLS] Notch signaling plays an instrumental role in hippocampus-dependent memory formation and recent evidence indicates a displacement of Notch1 and a reduction  its activity in hippocampal and cortical neurons from Alzheimers disease (AD) patients. As Notch activation depends on ligand availability, we investigated whether Jagged1 expression was altered in brain specimen of AD patients. We found that Jagged1 expression was reduced in the CA fields and that there was a gradual reduction of Jagged1 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with the progression of dementia. Given the role of Notch signaling in memory encoding, we investigated whether targeted loss of Jagged1 in neurons may be responsible for the memory loss seen in AD patients. Using a transgenic mouse model, we show that the targeted loss of Jagged1 expression during adulthood is sufficient to cause spatial memory loss and a reduction in exploration-dependent Notch activation. We also show that Jagged1 is selectively [MASK] at the presynaptic terminals in mice. Overall, the present data emphasizes the role of the Notch ligand, Jagged1, in memory formation and the potential deficit of the signaling ligand in AD patients. [SEP]\t\tenriched\n",

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Various types of dementia and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) are manifested as irregularities in human speech and language, which have proven to be strong predictors for the disease presence and progress ion. Therefore, automatic speech analytics provided by a mobile application may be a useful tool  in providing additional indicators for assessment and detection of early stage dementia and MCI. METHOD: 165 participants (subjects with subjective cognitive impairment (SCI), MCI patients, Alzheimers disease (AD) and mixed dementia (MD) patients) were recorded with a mobile application while performing several short vocal cognitive tasks during a regular consultation. These tasks included verbal fluency, picture description, counting down and a free speech task. The voice recordings were processed in two steps: in the first step, vocal markers were extracted using speech signal processing techniques; in the second, the vocal markers were tested to assess their power to distinguish between SCI, MCI, AD and MD. The second step included training automatic classifiers for detecting MCI and AD, based on machine learning methods, and testing the detection accuracy. RESULTS: The fluency and free speech tasks obtain the highest accuracy rates of classifying AD vs. MD vs. MCI vs. SCI. Using the data, we demonstrated classification accuracy as follows: SCI vs. AD = 92% accuracy; SCI vs. MD = 92% accuracy; SCI vs. MCI = 86% accuracy and MCI vs. AD = 86%. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate the potential value of vocal analytics and the  use of a mobile application for accurate automatic differentiation between SCI, MCI and AD.

Participants were older adults (=70 years) without dementia who underwent preoperative MRI and elective surgery. Delirium incidence  and [MASK] were evaluated daily during hospitalization. Cortical thickness was  averaged across a published set of a priori brain regions to derive a measure known as the \"AD signature.\" Logistic and linear regression was used, respectively, to test whether the AD signature was associated with delirium incidence in the entire sample (N = 145) or with the [MASK] of delirium among those who developed delirium (N = 32).

      "[CLS] ?-Secretase produces ß-amyloid (Aß) within its presenilin (PS1) subunit, mutations in which cause Alzheimers disease, and current therapies thus seek to  modulate its activity. While the general structure is known from recent electron  microscopy studies, direct loop and membrane interactions and explicit dynamics relevant to substrate processing remain unknown. We report a modeled structure utilizing the optimal multitemplate information available, including loops and [MASK] side chains, account of maturation cleavage, and explicit all-atom molecular dynamics in the membrane. We observe three distinct conformations of ?-secretase (open, semiopen, and closed) that remarkably differ by tilting of helices 2 and 3 of PS1, directly controlling active site availability. The large  hydrophilic loop of PS1 where maturation occurs reveals a new helix segment that  parallels the likely helix character of other substrates. The semiopen conformation consistently shows the best fit of Aß peptides, that is, longer residence before release and by inference more trimming. In contrast, the closed, hydrophobic conformation is largely inactive and the open conformation is active  but provides fewer optimal interactions and induces shorter residence time and by inference releases Aß peptides of longer lengths. Our simulations thus provide a  molecular basis for substrate processing and changes in the Aß42/Aß40 ratio. Accordingly, selective binding to protect the semiopen \"innocent\" conformation provides a molecular recipe for effective ?-secretase modulators; we provide the  full atomic structures for these states that may play a key role in developing selective ?-secretase modulators for treatment of Alzheimers disease.

Aß42 levels were significantly lower in NPH than in control patients, with no significant differences between AD and NPH. On the contrary, t-tau and p-tau levels were significantly lower in NPH than in AD, with no differences between NPH and controls. NPH patients with pathological Aß42 levels  did not perform worse than NPH patients with normal Aß42 levels in any cognitive  domains. Our data seem to support the hypothesis of amyloid accumulation in brains of NPH patients. Nevertheless, amyloid does not seem to play a pathogenetic role in the development of cognitive deficits in NPH. [SEP]\t\t(AD)\n",

      "[CLS] We report the synthesis and pharmacological investigation of analogs of the endogenous molecule kynurenic acid (KYNA) as multifunctional agents for the treatment of Alzheimers disease (AD). Synthesized KYNA analogs were tested for their N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor binding, mGluR5 binding and function,  acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging, interference with the [MASK] ß peptide (Aß) fibrillation process, and protection against Aß-induced toxicity in transgenic Caenorhabditis  elegans strain GMC101 expressing full-length Aß42. Molecular modeling studies were also performed to predict the binding modes of most active compounds with NMDAR, mGluR5, and Aß42. Among the synthesized analogs, 3c, 5b, and 5c emerged as multifunctional compounds that act via multiple anti-AD mechanisms including AChE inhibition, free radical scavenging, NMDA receptor binding, mGluR5 binding, inhibition of Aß42 fibril formation, and disassembly of preformed Aß42 fibrils. Interestingly, 5c showed protection against Aß42-induced toxicity in transgenic C. elegans strain GMC101. Moreover, 5b and 5c displayed high permeability in an MDR1-MDCKII cell-based model of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Compound 3b emerged with specific activity as a micromolar AChE inhibitor, however it had low permeability in the BBB model. This study highlights the opportunities that exist to develop analogs of endogenous molecules from the kynurenine pathway for therapeutic uses. [SEP]\t\tamyloid\n",

      "[CLS] The association of lysosomal dysfunction and neurodegeneration has been documented in several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimers Disease (AD). Herein, we investigate the association of lysosomal enzymes with AD at different stages of progression of the disease (mild and severe) or with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We conducted a screening of two classes of lysosomal  enzymes: glycohydrolases (ß-Hexosaminidase, ß-Galctosidase, ß-Galactosylcerebrosidase, ß-Glucuronidase) and proteases (Cathepsins S, D, B, L) in peripheral blood [MASK] (blood plasma and PBMCs) from mild AD, severe AD, MCI and healthy control subjects. We confirmed the lysosomal dysfunction in severe AD patients and added new findings enhancing the association of abnormal levels of specific lysosomal enzymes with the mild AD or severe AD, and highlighting the difference of AD from MCI. Herein, we showed for the first time the specific alteration of ß-Galctosidase (Gal), ß-Galactosylcerebrosidase (GALC) in MCI patients. It is notable that in above peripheral biological [MASK] the lysosomes are more sensitive to AD cellular metabolic alteration when compared to levels of Aß-peptide or Tau proteins, similar in both AD groups analyzed. Collectively, our findings support the role of lysosomal enzymes as potential peripheral molecules  that vary with the progression of AD, and make them useful for monitoring regenerative medicine approaches for AD.

      "[CLS] Alzheimers disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory deficits and cognitive decline. Excessive amyloid-ß (Aß)  peptide aggregates and forms soluble oligomers and insoluble cerebral amyloid plaques, which is widely thought to be the underlying pathogenic mechanism of AD. Therefore, effective regulation of Aß metabolism is an important aspect of preventing and improving AD. Berberine, which is the main active component of the traditional medicinal herb Coptidis rhizoma, has a positive effect on reducing Aß levels. However, the exact mechanism involved is unclear and requires more investigation. In the present study, we examined the role of berberine in the activation of [MASK] protein kinase (AMPK) in neuroblastoma cells and primary cultured neurons and sought to characterize the role of AMPK in the metabolism of Aß. The results indicate that berberine reduces Aß generation and decreases the expression of ß-site APP cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE1) via activating AMPK in N2a mouse neuroblastoma cells stably expressing human Swedish mutant APP695 (N2a/APP695sw), N2a cells, and primary cultured cortical neurons. Therefore, berberine reduced the accumulation of Aß, which likely contributes to  its memory enhancing effect in patients with AD. [SEP]\t\tAMP-activated\n",

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Mixed vascular and neurodegenerative dementia, such as Alzheimers disease (AD) with concomitant cerebrovascular disease, has emerged as the leading cause of age-related cognitive impairment. The brain [MASK] matter (WM) microstructural changes in neurodegeneration well-documented by diffusion tensor  imaging (DTI) can originate from brain tissue or extracellular free water changes. The differential microstructural and free water changes in AD with and without cerebrovascular disease, especially in normal-appearing WM, remain largely unknown. To cover these gaps, we aimed to characterize the WM free water  and tissue microstructural changes in AD and mixed dementia as well as their associations with cognition using a novel free water imaging method. METHODS: We compared WM free water and free water-corrected DTI measures as well  as [MASK] matter hyperintensity (WMH) in patients with AD with and without cerebrovascular disease, patients with vascular dementia, and age-matched healthy control subjects. RESULTS: The cerebrovascular disease groups had higher free water than the non-cerebrovascular disease groups. Importantly, besides the cerebrovascular disease groups, patients with AD without cerebrovascular disease also had increased free water in normal-appearing WM compared with healthy control subjects, reflecting mild vascular damage. Such free water increases in WM or normal-appearing WM (but not WMH) contributed to dementia severity. Whole-brain voxel-wise analysis revealed a close association between widespread free water increases and poorer attention, executive functioning, visual construction, and motor performance, whereas only left hemispheric free water increases were related to language deficits. Moreover, compared with the original DTI metrics, the free water-corrected DTI metric revealed tissue damage-specific (frontal and  occipital) microstructural differences between the cerebrovascular disease and non-cerebrovascular disease groups. In contrast to both lobar and subcortical/brainstem free water increases, only focal lobar microstructural damage was associated with poorer cognitive performance. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that free water analysis isolates probable mild vascular damage from WM microstructural alterations and underscore the importance of normal-appearing WM changes underlying cognitive and functional impairment in  AD with and without cerebrovascular disease. Further developed, the combined free water and tissue neuroimaging assays could help in differential diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring of patients with mixed dementia.

      "[CLS] INTRODUCTION: BACE 1 is a protease that cleaves the transmembrane amyloid precursor protein [MASK] generates amyloid-ß peptides that accumulate in AD brains.  No known mutations are identified in the gene encoding BACE1 in AD. However, enzyme levels are elevated in AD [MASK] a single residue mutation in amyloid precursor protein protects against protein cleavage by BACE1, suggesting BACE involvement in disease pathogenesis. Drugs that can inhibit BACE1 would theoretically prevent Aß accumulation [MASK] halt AD onset [MASK] progression. Areas covered: This review discusses clinical developments of BACE1 inhibitors [MASK] focuses on what is learned about these inhibitors as a potential treatment. Expert opinion: BACE1 inhibition as a therapeutic strategy to improve cognition in AD has been challening. Brain-penetrant BACE1 inhibitors have been developed [MASK] clinical trials are underway, both safety [MASK] efficacy are questionable. Several clinical trials suggest that BACE1 inhibition [MASK] other immunotherapies to reduce brain Aß are insufficient to improve cognition in AD. This may be due to the emphasis on the amyloid hypothesis despite big failures. We may have to seriously consider shifting attention to therapeutic strategies other than BACE1  inhibition or reduction of Aß alone [MASK] pay more attention to simultaneous clearance of tau [MASK] Aß.

      "[CLS] The incidence of neurological disorders is growing in developed countries toge[MASK]r with increased lifespan. Nowadays, [MASK]re are still no effective treatments for neurodegenerative pathologies, which make necessary to search for  new [MASK]rapeutic agents. Natural products, most of [MASK]m used in traditional medicine, are considered promising alternatives for [MASK] treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Honokiol is a natural bioactive phenylpropanoid compound, belonging to [MASK] class of neolignan, found in notable amounts in [MASK] bark of Magnolia tree, and has been reported to exert diverse pharmacological properties including neuroprotective activities. Honokiol can permeate [MASK] blood  brain barrier and [MASK] blood-cerebrospinal fluid to increase its bioavailability in neurological tissues. Diverse studies have provided evidence on [MASK] neuroprotective effect of honokiol in [MASK] central nervous system, due to its potent antioxidant activity, and amelioration of [MASK] excitotoxicity mainly related to [MASK] blockade of glutamate receptors and reduction in neuroinflammation. In addition, recent studies suggest that honokiol can attenuate neurotoxicity exerted by abnormally aggregated Aß in Alzheimers disease. The present work summarizes what is currently known concerning [MASK] neuroprotective effects of honokiol and its potential molecular mechanisms of action, which make it considered as a promising agent in [MASK] treatment and management of neurodegenerative diseases. © 2017 BioFactors, 43(6):760-769, 2017.

      "[CLS] Population aging is an irreversible global trend with economic and socio-political consequences. One of the most invalidating outcomes of aging in the elderly is cognitive decline, leading to dementia and often related to neurodegenerative disorders. Among these latter, Alzheimers disease (AD) is the  major ca[MASK] of dementia, affecting more than 30 million of individuals worldwide. To date, the treatment of AD remains a challenge beca[MASK] of an incomplete understanding of the events that lead to the selective neurodegeneration typical  of Alzheimers brains.

One promising strategy is the [MASK] of nutraceuticals as integrative, complementary and preventive therapy. Curcumin is one example of natural product with anti-AD properties, with promising potential for prevention, treatment and diagnostic. The limitations in  the [MASK] of curcumin as therapeutic are represented by its pharmacokinetics profile and the low bioavailability after oral administration.

      "[CLS] Although cerebrovascular diseases have been considered as risk factors for cognitive decline and dementia, the associations between atherosclerosis and Alzheimers disease (AD) have not been fully examined and remain controversial. The aim of this three-year prospective study was to investigate whether arotid artery atherosclerosis accelerates cognitive impairment in AD [MASK] The association of carotid intimal medial thickness (IMT) with prospective trajectories of cognitive function was assessed among 521 patients with light to  moderate AD, and 437 AD patients were followed up annually for 3 years. Participants underwent initial carotid ultrasonography and repeated neuropsychological testing every year. Mixed-effects regression analyses were adjusted to estimate the effect of carotid IMT and other adjusting variables. The results of the present study indicated that carotid IMT was significantly associated with various measures of cognitive function. Furthermore, AD patients  with higher carotid IMT values had a faster decline in cognitive scores in a variety of neuropsychological tests, particularly in verbal and non-verbal memory, semantic fluency and executive function. The present prospective study showed that carotid atherosclerosis is a predictive factor regarding the progression of cognitive impairment in AD patients, suggesting that early detection and treatment of vascular risk factors may prevent or at least postpone the evolution of the disease.

      "[CLS] OBJECTIVE: The goal [MASK] the evidence review was to evaluate the effectiveness [MASK] interventions for caregivers [MASK] people with Alzheimers disease and related major neurocognitive disorders that facilitate the ability to maintain participation in the caregiver role. METHOD: Scientific literature published in English between January 2006 and April 2014 was reviewed. Databases included MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, OTseeker, and the Cochrane Database [MASK] Systematic Reviews. RESULTS: Of 2,476 records screened, 43 studies met inclusion criteria. Strong evidence shows that multicomponent psychoeducational interventions improve caregiver quality [MASK] life (QOL), confidence, and self-efficacy and reduce burden; cognitive reframing reduces caregiver anxiety, depression, and stress; communication skills training improves caregiver skill and QOL in persons with dementia; mindfulness-based training improves caregiver mental health and reduces stress and burden; and pr[MASK]essionally led support groups enhance caregiver QOL. CONCLUSION: Strong evidence exists for a spectrum [MASK] caregiver interventions. Translation [MASK] effective interventions into practice and evaluation [MASK] sustainability is necessary.

      "[CLS] PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to prepare a patient friendly long acting donepezil (D) nanocrystals (NCs) formulation, with a high payload for i.m  administration. As the native D hydrochloride salt [MASK] high aqueous solubility it is necessary to increase its hydrophobicity prior to the NCs formation. METHODS: D was ionically paired with embonic acid (E) in aqueous media and was successfully characterized using techniques like DSC, PXRD, FT-IR, NMR etc. Later, we converted the bulk ion pair into NCs using high pressure homogenization technique to study further in-vitro and in-vivo. RESULTS: The bulk ion pair [MASK] a drug content of 66% w/w and an 11,000 reduced solubility in comparison to native D hydrochloride. Also, its crystalline nature  was confirmed by DSC and PXRD. The possible interaction sites responsible for the ion pair formation were identified though NMR. The prepared NCs [MASK] mean particle size 677.5 ± 72.5 nm and PDI 0.152 ± 0.061. In-vitro release showed a slow dissolution of NCs. Further, excellent bio compatibility of NCs were demonstrated in 3T3 cells. Following i.m administration of single dose of NCs, the D plasma level was found to be detectable up to 18 days. In vivo pharmacodynamic studies revealed that the single dose NCs i.m injection improved spatial memory learning  and retention in ICV STZ model. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the developed formulation [MASK] a potential to replace the current daily dosing regimen to a less frequent dosing schedule.

      "[CLS] Alzheimers disease (AD) is reaching epidemic proportions yet treatment strategies are limited and are restricted to providing symptomatic relief for the cognitive and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) has been a valuable source of medicines for centuries and research has burgeoned in recent years to understand the scientific basis for their use. Some plants have been used in CHM for AD symptoms (e.g., Polygala tenuifolia), while others are CHMs for different conditions, but they show mechanistic effects relevant to AD (e.g., Salvia miltiorrhiza). Some CHMs (e.g.,  [MASK] biloba extract, and huperzine A from Huperzia serrata) show pharmacological activities relevant to AD, and promising effects on cognitive functions in clinical trials. Other CHMs show effects relevant to BPSD (e.g., Crocus sativus). This chapter discusses available scientific evidence for CHM plants and formulae that have been used both traditionally for AD, and those that have been used traditionally but not specifically for AD symptoms, and encompasses chemical, pharmacological and clinical studies. The ethnopharmacological approach to understanding the use of CHMs for AD is also discussed. [SEP]\t\tGinkgo\n",

      "[CLS] Chronic stress is a risk factor for a number of physiological disorders including cardiovascular disease, obesity [MASK] gastrointestinal disorders, as well as psychiatric [MASK] neurodegenerative disorders. There are a number of underlying molecular [MASK] cellular mechanisms altered in the course of chronic stress, which  may increase the vulnerability of individuals to develop psychiatric disorders such as depression, [MASK] neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimers Disease (AD). This is evident in the influence of stress on large-scale brain networks, including the resting state Default Mode Network (DMN), the effects of stress on  neuronal circuitry [MASK] architecture, [MASK] the cellular [MASK] molecular adaptations to stress, which may render individuals with stress related psychiatric disorders more vulnerable to neurodegenerative disease later in life. These alterations include decreased negative feedback inhibition of the hypothalamic pituitary axis (HPA) axis, decreased dendritic arborization [MASK] spine density in the prefrontal  cortex (PFC) [MASK] hippocampus, [MASK] the release of proinflammatory cytokines, which may suppress neurogenesis [MASK] promote neuronal cell death. Each of these factors  are thought to play a role in stress-related psychiatric disease as well as AD, [MASK] have been observed in clinical [MASK] post-mortem studies of individuals with depression [MASK] AD. The goal of the current review is to summarize clinical [MASK] preclinical evidence supporting a role for chronic stress as a putative link between neuropsychiatric [MASK] neurodegenerative disease.

      "[CLS] Targeting protein aggregation for the therapy of neurodegenerative diseases remains elusive for medicinal chemists, despite a number of [MASK] molecules known to interfere in amyloidogenesis, particularly of amyloid beta (Aß) protein. Starting from previous findings in the antiaggregating activity of a class of indolin-2-ones inhibiting Aß fibrillization, 5-methoxyisatin 3-(4-isopropylphenyl)hydrazone 1 was identified as a multitarget inhibitor of Aß  aggregation and cholinesterases with IC50s in the low µM range. With the aim of increasing aqueous solubility, a Mannich-base functionalization led to the synthesis of N-methylpiperazine derivative 2. At acidic pH, an outstanding solubility increase of 2 over the parent compound 1 was proved through a turbidimetric method. HPLC analysis revealed an improved stability of the Mannich base 2 at pH2 along with a rapid release of 1 in human serum as well as an outstanding hydrolytic stability of the parent hydrazone. Coincubation of Aß1-42  with 2 resulted in the accumulation of low MW oligomers, as detected with PICUP assay. Cell assays on SH-SY5Y cells revealed that 2 exerts strong cytoprotective  effects in both cell viability and radical quenching assays, mainly related to its active metabolite 1. These findings show that 2 drives the formation of non-toxic, off-pathway Aß oligomers unable to trigger the amyloid cascade and toxicity. [SEP]\t\tsmall\n",

      "[CLS] By using fragments endowed with interesting and complementary properties for the  treatment of Alzheimers disease (AD), a novel series of cinnamamide-dibenzylamine hybrids have been designed, [MASK] and evaluated  biologically. In vitro assay indicated that most of the target compounds exhibited a significant ability to inhibit ChEs, strong potency inhibitory of self-induced ß-amyloid (Aß) aggregation and to act as potential antioxidants and  biometal chelators. A Lineweaver-Burk plot and molecular modeling study showed that compound 7f targeted both the CAS and PAS of AChE. In addition, compound 7f  could chelate metal ions, reduce PC12 cells death induced by oxidative stress and penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB).

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to investigate predictors  of atypical antipsychotic (AAP) treatment continuation and response by week 8 in  patients with Alzheimers disease (AD) who have psychotic/aggressive symptoms using the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness-Alzheimers Disease (CATIE-AD) dataset. METHODS: Clinical data was utilized from 421 AD outpatients with psychotic/aggressive symptoms who needed interventional treatment. Logistic regression analyses were performed to examine which baseline sociodemographic and clinical characteristics contributed to treatment continuation and response,  the latter of which was evaluated by the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), and Brief Psychiatric Scale (BPRS). RESULTS: The treatment continuation rate was 48.7%, and CGI-C, NPI, and BPRS response rate by the last observation carried forward method were 42.7%, 48.6%, and 37.5%, respectively. No significant predictor was identified for treatment continuation in the Caucasian patients (n?=?331), while better treatment response was predicted by a lower Mini-Mental State Examination score, treatment with risperidone (versus olanzapine and [MASK]), history of diabetes mellitus, healthier physical status, and more severe initial psychotic symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Comparatively high intolerability from AAPs in the short term was confirmed. We found that baseline clinical predictors to treatment response in Caucasian AD patients with psychotic/aggressive symptoms include treatment with risperidone (versus [MASK] and olanzapine), diabetes mellitus, global physical status, cognitive impairment, and psychotic symptoms. Going forward, these findings may help to determine treatment strategies or care plans. [SEP]\t\tquetiapine\n",

      "[CLS] In this study, we investigated the early detection of Alzheimers disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) conversion to AD through individual structural connectivity networks using structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) data. In the proposed method, the cortical morphometry of individual gray  matter images were used to construct structural connectivity networks. A statistical feature generation approach based on [MASK] feature generation procedure was proposed to represent a statistical-pattern of connectivity networks from a high-dimensional space into low-dimensional feature  vectors. The proposed method was evaluated on numerous samples including 61 healthy controls (HC), 42 stable-MCI (sMCI), 45 progressive-MCI (pMCI), and 83 AD subjects at the baseline from the J-ADNI data-set using support vector machine classifier. The proposed method yielded a classification accuracy of 84.17%, 70.38%, and 61.05% in identifying AD/HC, MCIs/HCs, and sMCI/pMCI, respectively. The experimental results show that the proposed method performed in a comparable  way to alternative methods using MRI data. [SEP]\t\thistogram-based\n",

      "[CLS] Self-association of amyloid ß (Aß) peptides is a hallmark of Alzheimers disease  and serves as a general prototype for amyloid formation. A key endogenous [MASK]hibitor of Aß self-association is human serum album[MASK] (HSA), which b[MASK]ds ~90% of plasma Aß. However, the exact molecular mechanism by which HSA b[MASK]ds Aß monomers and protofibrils is not fully understood. Here, us[MASK]g dark-state exchange saturation transfer NMR and relaxation experiments complemented by morphological characterization, we mapped the HSA-Aß [MASK]teractions at atomic resolution by exam[MASK][MASK]g the effects of HSA on Aß monomers and soluble high-molecular weight oligomeric protofibrils. We found that HSA b[MASK]ds both monomeric and protofibrillar Aß, but the aff[MASK]ity of HSA for Aß monomers is lower than for Aß protofibrils (Kd values are submillimolar rather than micromolar) yet physiologically relevant because of the ~0.6-0.7 mm plasma HSA concentration. In  both Aß protofibrils and monomers, HSA targets key Aß self-recognition sites spann[MASK]g the ß strands found [MASK] cross-ß protofibril structures, lead[MASK]g to a net  switch from direct to tethered contacts between the monomeric Aß and the protofibril surface. These HSA-Aß [MASK]teractions are isoform-specific, because the  HSA aff[MASK]ity of Aß monomers is lower for Aß(1-42) than for Aß(1-40). In addition, the HSA-[MASK]duced perturbations of the monomer/protofibrils pseudo-equilibrium extend to the C-term[MASK]al residues [MASK] the Aß(1-42) isoform but not [MASK] Aß(1-40). These results provide an unprecedented view of how album[MASK] [MASK]teracts with Aß and  illustrate the potential of dark-state exchange saturation transfer NMR [MASK] mapp[MASK]g the [MASK]teractions between amyloid-[MASK]hibitory prote[MASK]s and amyloidogenic peptides.

      "[CLS] Background: The specific metabolomic perturbations that occur in vitamin B-12 deficiency, and [MASK]ir associations with neurological function, are not well characterized.Objective: We sought to characterize [MASK] human serum metabolome in  subclinical vitamin B-12 deficiency and repletion.Methods: A before-and-after treatment study provided 1 injection of 10 mg vitamin B-12 (with 100 mg pyridoxine and 100 mg thiamin) to 27 community-dwelling elderly Chileans (~74 y old) with vitamin B-12 deficiency, as evaluated with serum vitamin B-12, total plasma homocysteine (tHcy), methylmalonic acid (MMA), and holotranscobalamin. The combined indicator of vitamin B-12 status (cB-12) was computed. Targeted metabolites [166 acylcarnitines, amino acids, sugars, glycerophospholipids, and sphingolipids (liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry)], and untargeted metabolites [247 chemical entities (gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry)] were measured at baseline and 4 mo after treatment. A peripheral nerve score was developed. Differences before and after treatment were examined.  For targeted metabolomics, [MASK] data from 18 individuals with adequate vitamin B-12 status (selected from [MASK] same population) were added to [MASK] before-and-after treatment data set. Network visualizations and metabolic pathways are illustrated.Results: The injection increased serum vitamin B-12, holotranscobalamin, and cB-12 (P < 0.001), and reduced tHcy and serum MMA (P < 0.001). Metabolomic changes from before to after treatment included increases (P  < 0.001) in acylcarnitines, plasmalogens, and o[MASK]r phospholipids, whereas proline and o[MASK]r intermediaries of one-carbon metabolism-that is, methionine and cysteine-were reduced (P < 0.001). Direct significant correlations (P < 0.05 after [MASK] false discovery rate procedure) were identified between acylcarnitines, plasmalogens, phospholipids, lyso-phospholipids, and sphingomyelins compared with vitamin B-12 status and nerve function. Multiple connections were identified with primary metabolites (e.g., an inverse relation between vitamin B-12 markers and tryptophan, tyrosine, and pyruvic, succinic, and citric acids, and a direct correlation between [MASK] nerve score and arginine).Conclusions: The human serum metabolome in vitamin B-12 deficiency and [MASK] changes that occur after supplementation are characterized. Metabolomics revealed connections between vitamin B-12 status and serum metabolic markers of mitochondrial function, myelin integrity, oxidative stress, and peripheral nerve function, including some previously implicated in Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases.

      "[CLS] SIGNIFICANCE: The p53 family of transcription factors, including [MASK] p63, and p73, plays key roles in both biological and pathological processes, including cancer and neural development. Recent Advances: In recent years, a growing body of evidence has indicated that the entire p53 family is involved in the regulation of the central nervous system (CNS) functions as well as in the pathogenesis of several neurological disorders. Mechanistically, the p53 proteins control neuronal cell fate, terminal differentiation, and survival, via a complex interplay among the family members. CRITICAL ISSUES: In this article, we discuss the involvement of the p53 family in neurobiology and in pathological conditions affecting the CNS, including neuroinflammation. FUTURE DIRECTIONS: Understanding the molecular mechanism(s) underlying the function of the p53 family could improve our general knowledge of the pathogenesis of brain disorders and potentially pave the road for new therapeutic intervention.

      "[CLS] a7-nACh is one of the major nicotinic cholinergic receptor subtypes found in the  brain. It is broadly expressed in the hippocampal and cortical neurons, the regions which play a key role in memory formation. Although a7-nACh receptors may serve as postsynaptic receptors mediating classical neurotransmission, they usually function as presynaptic [MASK] responsible for the release of other neurotransmitters, such as glutamate, ?-aminobutyric acid, dopamine, and norepinephrine. They can, therefore, affect a wide array of neurobiological functions. In recent years, research has found that a large number of agonists and positive allosteric [MASK] of a7-nAChR induce beneficial effects on learning and memory. Consistently, mice deficient in chrna7 (the gene encoding a7-nAChR protein), are characterized by memory deficits. In addition, decreased expression and function of a7-nAChR is associated agoniwith many neurological diseases including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, learning disability, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, Alzheimer disease, autism, and epilepsy. In the recent years many animal experiments and clinical trials using a7-nAChR ligands were conducted. The results of these studies strongly indicate that agonists and positive allosteric [MASK] of a7-nAChR are promising therapeutic agents for diseases associated with cognitive deficits.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Because of the enormous social [MASK] economic burden of disease, the prevention of mild cognitive impairment [MASK] Alzheimers-type dementia has become  a major global public health priority. Studies show that cognitively stimulating  activities during middle adulthood might have a protective effect on the brain by boosting the cognitive reserve. The aim of this review is to identify evidence investigating the effects of continuing education for the prevention of mild cognitive impairment [MASK] Alzheimers-type dementia in late life. METHODS: Our approach employs a two-stage design: First, we will conduct a systematic review to assess the preventive effects of continuing education on mild cognitive impairment [MASK] Alzheimers-type dementia. Second, because we expect to find few studies, we will perform a review of systematic reviews on leisure activities that mimic formal continuing education to determine their effects on the prevention of mild cognitive impairment [MASK] Alzheimers-type dementia. We will search electronic databases (e.g., MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, [MASK] Scopus) for published studies [MASK] gray literature databases  (e.g., trial registries) for unpublished studies. Two authors will independently  screen abstracts [MASK] full-texts using pre-defined eligibility criteria, select studies, extract data, [MASK] assess the quality of included studies or reviews. Outcomes of interest include the incidence of mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimers-type dementia, quality of life, functional capacity, [MASK] psychological wellbeing. Intermediate outcomes are cognitive (test) performance,  cognitive functioning, [MASK] social inclusion. The review team is a multidisciplinary group consisting of methodological experts [MASK] dementia, geriatrics, [MASK] continuing education researchers. DISCUSSION: We anticipate that our review will highlight serious gaps in the current evidence. Results will build the basis for further research regarding the relation of continuing education [MASK] cognitive decline [MASK] dementia. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42017063944.

      "[CLS] The astrocytes have gained in recent decades an enormous interest as a potential  target for neurotherapies, due to their essential and pleiotropic roles in brain  physiology and pathology. Their precise regulation is still far from understood,  although several candidate molecules/systems arise as promising targets for astrocyte-mediated neuroregulation and/or neuroprotection. The cannabinoid system and its ligands have been shown to interact and affect activities of astrocytes.  Cannabidiol ([MASK]) is the main non-psychotomimetic cannabinoid derived from Cannabis. [MASK] is devoid of direct CB1 and CB2 receptor activity, but exerts a number of important effects in the brain. Here, we attempt to sum up the current  findings on the effects of [MASK] on astrocyte activity, and in this way on central  nervous system (CNS) functions, across various tested models and neuropathologies. The collected data shows that increased astrocyte activity is suppressed in the presence of [MASK] in models of ischemia, Alzheimer-like and Multiple-Sclerosis-like neurodegenerations, sciatic nerve injury, epilepsy, and schizophrenia. Moreover, [MASK] has been shown to decrease proinflammatory functions and signaling in astrocytes. [SEP]\t\tCBD\n",

      "[CLS] Tacrine (THA), the first clinically effective acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor and the first approved drug for the treatment [MASK] Alzheimers disease (AD), was withdrawn from the market due to its side effects, particularly its hepatotoxicity. Nowadays, THA serves as a valuable scaffold for the design [MASK] novel agents potentially applicable for AD treatment. One such compound, namely 7-methoxytacrine (7-MEOTA), exhibits an intriguing pr[MASK]ile, having suppressed hepatotoxicity and concomitantly retaining AChE inhibition properties. Another interesting class [MASK] AChE inhibitors represents Huprines, designed by merging two fragments [MASK] the known AChE inhibitors-THA and (-)-huperzine A. Several members [MASK] this compound family are more potent human AChE inhibitors than the parent compounds. The most promising are so-called huprines X and Y. Here, we report the design, synthesis, biological evaluation, and in silico studies [MASK] 2-methoxyhuprine that amalgamates structural features [MASK] 7-MEOTA and huprine Y in one molecule.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND/AIMS: Although some patients with primary progressive aphasia (PPA) exhibit novel or improved skills after the onset of dementia, these changes have  yet to be quantified. Therefore, this study systematically explored and identified the emergence of positive behaviours after dementia onset. METHODS: This study included 48 carers of patients with PPA: 12 nonfluent/agrammatic PPA (nfvPPA), 22 semantic variant PPA (svPPA), and 14 logopenic variant PPA (lvPPA). The presence and frequency of positive behaviour changes after dementia onset were established using the Hypersensory and Social/Emotional Scale (HSS). RESULTS: Scores on Sensitivity to Details, Visuospatial Activities, and Music Activities differed significantly among the groups. More specifically, svPPA was  associated with increased visuospatial activity, but only in the mild stage of the disease; nfvPPA was associated with increased visuospatial activity and decreased music activity, while lvPPA exhibited the [MASK] profile. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that subsets of PPA patients show novel or increased positive behaviours following dementia onset, and differences among subtypes may be helpful for improving diagnostic accuracy. Additionally, harnessing these skills may improve the quality of life of both patients and carers. [SEP]\t\treverse\n",

AD affects the cognition, behavior, function, and physiology of patients through mechanisms that are still being elucidated. Current AD diagnosis is contingent on evaluating which symp[MASK]ms and signs a patient does or does not display.

      "[CLS] Alzheimers disease (AD) is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder and it is  the most common form of dementia in the elderly.

Late onset AD (LOAD) is complex and apolipoprotein E is the only unanimously accepted genetic risk fac[MASK]r for its development. Various genes implicated in AD have been identified using advanced genetic technologies, however, there are many additional genes that remain unidentified.

      "[CLS] OBJECTIVE: To apply network-based statistics to diffusion-weighted imaging tractography data and detect Alzheimer disease vs non-Alzheimer degeneration in the context of corticobasal syndrome. METHODS: In a cross-sectional design, pathology was confirmed by autopsy or a pathologically validated CSF total tau-to-ß-amyloid ratio (T-tau/Aß). Using structural MRI data, we identify association areas in fronto-temporo-parietal cortex with reduced gray matter density in corticobasal syndrome (n = 40) relative to age-matched controls (n = 40). Using these fronto-temporo-parietal regions of interest, we construct structural brain networks in clinically similar subgroups of individuals with Alzheimer disease (n = 21) or non-Alzheimer pathology (n = 19) by linking these regions by the number of white matter streamlines identified in a deterministic tractography analysis of diffusion tensor imaging data. We characterize these structural networks using 5 graph-based [MASK] and assess their relative utility in classifying underlying pathology with leave-one-out cross-validation using a supervised support vector machine. RESULTS: Gray matter density poorly discriminates between Alzheimer disease and non-Alzheimer pathology subgroups with low sensitivity (57%) and specificity (52%). In contrast, a statistic of local network efficiency demonstrates very good discriminatory power, with 85% sensitivity and 84% specificity. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the underlying pathologic sources of corticobasal syndrome can be classified more accurately using graph theoretical statistics derived from patterns of white matter network organization in association cortex than by regional gray matter density alone. These results highlight the importance of a multimodal neuroimaging approach to diagnostic analyses of corticobasal syndrome. [SEP]\t\tstatistics,\n",

      "[CLS] Differential scanning calorimetry was applied to evaluate the efficacy of preventive treatments with biologically [MASK] compounds of plant origin against  neurodegenerative disorder in mice. As we reported recently, large differences exist between the heat capacity profiles of water-soluble brain proteome fractions from healthy animals and from animals with scopolamine-induced dementia: the profiles for healthy animals displayed well expressed exothermic event peaking at 40-45°C, by few degrees above body temperature, but still preceding in temperature the proteome endothermic denaturational transitions; the low-temperature exotherm was completely abolished by the scopolamine treatment. Here we explored this signature difference in the heat capacity profiles to assess the efficacy of preventive treatments with protectant drugs anticipated to slow down or block progression of dementia (myrtenal, ellagic acid, lipoic acid and their combinations, including also ascorbic acid). We found that these neuroprotectants counteract the scopolamine effect and partially or completely preserve the healthy thermogram, and specifically the low-temperature exotherm. These results well correlate with the changes in the cognitive functions of the animals assessed using the Step Through Test for learning and memory. The exothermic event is deemed to be associated with a reversible process of fibrillization and/or aggregation of specific water-soluble brain protein fractions preceding their denaturation. Most importantly, the results demonstrate that the effect of scopolamine and its prevention by protectant substances are clearly displayed in the heat capacity profiles of the brain proteome, thus identifying DSC as a powerful method in drug testing and discovery.

The regulatory effects of these risk variants on the expression of a novel class of non-coding RNAs (piRNAs) and protein-coding RNAs (mRNAs), the alteration of proteins caused by these variants, the associations between AD and these variants in our own sample, the expression of piRNAs, mRNAs and proteins in human brains targeted by these variants, the expression correlations between the risk genes and APOE, the pathways and networks that the risk genes belonged to, and the possible long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) that might regulate the risk genes were analyzed, to investigate the potential biological functions of the risk variants  and explore the potential mechanisms underlying the SNP-AD associations. We found replicated and signifi[MASK]t associations for AD or AD-biomarkers, surprisingly, only at 17 SNPs located in 11 genes/snRNAs/LncRNAs in eight genomic regions. Most of these 17 SNPs enriched some AD-related pathways or networks, and were potentially functional in regulating piRNAs and mRNAs; some SNPs were associated  with AD in our sample, and some SNPs altered protein structures. Most of the protein-coding genes regulated by the risk SNPs were expressed in human brain and correlated with APOE expression.

The mechanism should be  enhanced by Aß antibodies that form immune complexes (ICs) with Aß, and therefore may be relevant to current Aß immunotherapy approaches. METHODS: Multidisciplinary [MASK] were employed to demonstrate enhanced complement-mediated capture of Aß antibody immune complexes compared with Aß alone in both erythrocytes and THP1-derived macrophages. RESULTS: Aß antibodies dramatically increased complement activation and opsonization of Aß, followed by commensurately enhanced Aß capture by human erythrocytes and macrophages. These in vitro findings were consistent with enhanced peripheral clearance of intravenously administered Aß antibody immune complexes in nonhuman primates. DISCUSSION: Together with our previous results, showing significant Alzheimers disease deficits in peripheral Aß clearance, the present findings strongly suggest that peripheral mechanisms should not be ignored as contributors to the effects of Aß immunotherapy.

      "[CLS] In the last decades, the development of new technologies applied to lipidomics has revitalized the analysis of lipid profile alterations and the understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of lipid metabolism, together with their involvement in the occurrence of human disease. Of particular interest is the study of omega-3 and omega-6 long chain polyunsaturated [MASK] acids (LC-PUFAs), notably EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid, 20:5n-3), DHA (docosahexaenoic acid, 22:6n-3), and ARA (arachidonic acid, 20:4n-6), and their transformation into bioactive lipid mediators. In this sense, new families of PUFA-derived lipid mediators, including resolvins derived from EPA and DHA, and protectins and maresins derived from DHA, are being increasingly investigated because of their active role in the \"return to homeostasis\" process and resolution of inflammation. Recent findings reviewed in the present study highlight that the omega-6 [MASK] acid ARA appears increased, and omega-3 EPA and DHA decreased in most cancer tissues compared to normal ones, and that increments in omega-3 LC-PUFAs consumption and an omega-6/omega-3 ratio of 2-4:1, are associated with a reduced risk of breast, prostate, colon and renal cancers. Along with their lipid-lowering properties, omega-3 LC-PUFAs also exert cardioprotective functions, such as reducing platelet aggregation and inflammation, and controlling the presence of DHA in our body, especially in our liver and brain, which is crucial for optimal brain functionality. Considering that DHA is the principal omega-3 FA in cortical gray matter, the importance of DHA intake and its derived lipid mediators have been recently reported in patients with major depressive and bipolar disorders, Alzheimer disease, Parkinsons disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The present study reviews the relationships between major diseases occurring today in the Western world and LC-PUFAs. More specifically this review focuses on the dietary omega-3 LC-PUFAs and the omega-6/omega-3 balance, in a wide range of inflammation disorders, including autoimmune diseases. This review suggests that the current recommendations of consumption and/or supplementation of omega-3 FAs are specific to particular groups of age and physiological status, and still need more fine tuning for overall human health and well being.

      "[CLS] Quantification of medial temporal lobe (MTL) cortices, including entorhinal cortex (ERC) and perirhinal cortex (PRC), from in vivo MRI is desirable for studying the human memory system as well as in early diagnosis and monitoring of  Alzheimers disease. However, ERC and PRC are commonly over-segmented in T1-weighted (T1w) MRI because of the adjacent meninges that have similar intensity to gray matter in T1 contrast. This introduces errors in the quantification and could potentially confound imaging studies of ERC/PRC. In this paper, we propose to segment MTL cortices along with the adjacent meninges in T1w MRI using an established multi-atlas segmentation framework together with super-resolution technique. Experimental results comparing the proposed pipeline  with existing [MASK] support the notion that a large portion of meninges is segmented as gray matter by existing algorithms but not by our algorithm. Cross-validation experiments demonstrate promising segmentation accuracy. Further, agreement between the volume and thickness measures from the proposed pipeline and those from the manual segmentations increase dramatically as a result of accounting for the confound of meninges. Evaluated in the context of group discrimination between patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment and normal controls, the proposed pipeline generates more biologically plausible results and improves the statistical power in discriminating groups in absolute terms comparing to other techniques using T1w MRI. Although the performance of the proposed pipeline is inferior to that using T2-weighted MRI, which is optimized to image MTL sub-structures, the proposed pipeline could still provide  important utilities in analyzing many existing large datasets that only have T1w  MRI available.

      "[CLS] Alzheimers disease (AD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases  worldwide. Formation of amyloid plaques consisting of amyloid-ß peptides (Aß) is  one of the hallmarks of AD.

Extensive research has been conducted with the aim to reveal the structures of the neurotoxic Aß aggregates.

METHODS: We included patients from different cohorts with MDD (DSM-IV-TR: 296.20-296.23, 296.30-296.33; n = 42; mean ± SD age, 72.0 ± 8.0 years; female = 57.1%) included from 2002 to 2007, noneuthymic [MASK] (DSM-IV-TR: 296.00-296.06, 296.40-296.46, 296.50-296.56, 296.60-296.66, 296.7; DSM-IV-TR: 296.89; DSM-IV-TR: 296.80; n = 41; age, 71.7 ± 8.8 years; female = 53.7%) included from 2011 to 2015, nonremitted schizophrenia (DSM-IV-TR: 295.10, 295.20, 295.30, 295.60, 295.90; n = 47; age, 67.5 ± 7.1 years; female = 66%) included from 2006 to 2008,  or probable/definite bvFTD (n = 173; age, 62.6 ± 8.0 years; female = 39.9%) (Frontotemporal Dementia Consensus criteria) included from 2000 to 2015 and healthy controls (n = 78; age, 71.9 ± 8.0 years; female = 71.8%) included from 2005 to 2007. Neuropsychological tests concerned the domains of attention and working memory, verbal memory, verbal fluency, and executive functioning. Analyses of variance were performed with age, gender, and education level as covariates. Post hoc Bonferroni tests were used to detail group differences. RESULTS: Compared to the healthy controls, both the bvFTD and primary psychiatric disorder groups showed significant impairment on all cognitive domains. Executive function was more disturbed in all primary psychiatric disorders compared to bvFTD (P < .001). Attention and working memory were significantly better in the bvFTD and schizophrenia groups compared to the MDD and [MASK] groups (P < .001). For  verbal memory, the bvFTD group scored significantly higher compared to patients with schizophrenia, [MASK], or MDD (P < .001). Patients with bvFTD had significantly  lower scores on verbal fluency, especially due to Animal Naming, in comparison with the [MASK] group (P < .001); however, these scores were not significantly different from those of MDD or schizophrenia patients. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive deficits in bvFTD are less severe than in primary psychiatric disorders with active symptoms. This indicates that in the differential diagnosis of bvFTD, disturbances on tests for cognitive performance  do not rule out primary psychiatric diagnoses. [SEP]\t\tBD\n",

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (IPSC) Technology is the most advanced  research as it offers an attractive alternative for establishing patient-specific IPSCs to recapitulate phenotypes of not only monogenic diseases (viz. Thalassaemia, Sickle cell anemia, Haemophilia, Tay-Sachs disease), but also late-onset polygenic diseases (viz. Parkinsons disease, Alzheimers disease, schizophrenia). Over the hindsight, numerous studies of the past and current scientists have led to the production, maturation and understanding of induced pluripotent stem cell technology and its use in basic and clinical research. METHODS: A systematic search of peer-reviewed scientific literature and clinical  [MASK] in public databases were carried out to summarize the evidence on the use  of IPSC. RESULTS: Current review sheds light upon the use of patient-derived iPSC models in drug toxicity, screening and discovery which have been derived after referring to more than 200 articles in literature. Furthermore, their use as disease models was also studied signifying the versatility of iPSC lines.

Recently, a technique  of layer analysis was reported that allowed CBF to be analyzed from the outer to  inner layers of the brain. The aim of this work was to develop methods for discriminating between patients with mild AD and healthy subjects based on CBF images of the lateral views created with the layer analysis technique in xenon-enhanced computed tomography. METHODS: Xenon-enhanced computed tomography using a wide-volume CT was performed  on 17 patients with mild AD aged 75 or older and on 15 healthy age-matched volunteers. For each subject, we created CBF images of the right and left lateral views with a depth of 10-15?mm from the surface of the brain. Ten circular regions of interest (ROI) were placed on each image, and CBF was calculated for each [MASK] We determined discriminant ROI that had CBF that could be used to differentiate between the AD and volunteer groups. AD patients CBF range (mean?-?SD to mean?+?SD) and healthy volunteers CBF range (mean?-?SD to mean?+?SD) were obtained for each [MASK] Receiver-operator curves were created to identify patients with AD for each of the discriminant ROI and for the AD patients and healthy volunteers CBF ranges.

METHODS: A total of 2099 participants (1015 CHI, 478 patients with MCI, 331 patients with mild dementia and 275 with moderate dementia) were selected from the intercontinental \"Gait, cOgnitiOn & Decline\" (GOOD) initiative, which merged  different databases from seven cross-sectional studies. Mean values and coefficients of variation (CoV) of spatiotemporal gait parameters were recorded during usual walking with the GAITRite® system. RESULTS: The severity of cognitive impairment was associated with worse performance on all gait parameters. Stride velocity had the [MASK] association with cognitive impairment, regardless of cognitive status. High mean value and CoV of stride length characterized moderate dementia, whereas increased CoV of stride time was specific to MCI status.

All subjects were assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and its subtests verbal fluency, word list memory, delayed recall of the word list, word  list recognition test, Boston naming and constructive praxis from Consortium to Establish a Registry for [MASK] Disease (CERAD). The results were compared among the groups. RESULTS: A total of 50 healthy elderly with a mean age of 71.2 ± 5.2 years; 41 patients with glaucoma (72.2 ± 4.4 years); and 21 patients with AD (79.0 ± 7.6 years) were included. There was a reduction in all cognitive assessment tests evaluated, both for patients with glaucoma, and for those with AD compared with controls (p < 0.001 for all). Comparing the patients with glaucoma and AD, it was noted that the last had lower cognitive function (p < 0.001), except for the CERAD tests Boston (p = 0.1) and praxis (p = 0.6).

This study aimed to investigate the influence of demographics and current daily use of computer-based devices in older adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Alzheimers disease (AD). We [MASK] studied  the ability of the e-CT to discriminate MCI and AD patients from older adults with normal cognition (NC). METHODS: The e-CT was administered to 325 older adults (NC = 112, MCI = 129, AD = 84). Subjects also performed the K-T test, a paper-and-pencil cancellation test from which the e-CT was developed. Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to assess the contribution of demographics and current daily use of computer-based devices on the e-CT in patient groups. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) were established to compare the efficacy of the e-CT and the K-T test to classify subjects into diagnostic groups. RESULTS: In the MCI group, age (B = -0.37, p<0.001) and current daily use of computer-based devices (B = 5.85, p<0.001) were associated with the number of correct cancellations of the e-CT. In the AD group, only current daily use of a computer-based device was a significant contributor (B = 6.28, p<0.001). The e-CT (AUC = 0.811; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.756-0.867) and the K-T (AUC = 0.837; CI: 0.787-0.887) showed good and comparable diagnostic accuracy to discriminate between MCI and NC subjects. To discriminate between NC and AD, both tests showed high diagnostic accuracy, with the AUC values of 0.923 (CI: 0.876-0.971) and 0.929 (95%CI: 0.886-0.972) for the e-CT and the K-T, respectively.

In this study, we hypothesised that both cerebral and systemic microvascular pathologies exist in 4- to 5-month-old male APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) transgenic mice prior to the onset of cognitive impairment. To assess this we examined recognition memory in both wild-type and APP/PS1 mice using the object recognition task [MASK] n = 11 per group) and counted thioflavin-S-positive plaques in brain (n = 6 per group). Vascular casts  of brain, liver, spleen and kidneys were examined using scanning electron microscopy (n = 6 per group), and the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR;  n = 5 per group) was measured as an index of glomerular permeability. Murine recognition memory was intact, as demonstrated by a significant preference for the novel object in the ORT paradigm. Brain sections of wild-type mice were devoid of thioflavin-S positivity, whereas age-matched APP/PS1 mice had an average of 0.88 ± 0.22 thioflavin-S-positive plaques in the cortex, 0.42 ± 0.17 plaques in the dentate gyrus and 0.30 ± 0.07 plaques in the cornus ammonis 1 region. The profiles of casted cerebral capillaries of wild-type mice were smooth and regular in contrast to those of APP/PS1 mice which demonstrate characteristic (0.5-4.6 µm) tags. APP/PS1 mice also had a significantly reduced hepatic vessel number (p = 0.0002) and an increase in the number of splenic microvascular pillars (p = 0.0231), in the absence of changes in either splenic microvascular density (p = 0.3746) or glomerular ultrastructure. The highly significant reduction in uACR in APP/PS1 mice compared to wild-type (p = 0.0079) is consistent with glomerular microvascular dysfunction. These findings highlight early microvascular pathologies in 4- to 5-month-old APP/PS1 transgenic mice and  may indicate an amenable target for pharmacological intervention in AD. [SEP]\t\t(ORT;\n",

This extreme phenotype likely harbors highly penetrant risk variants, making it primed for discovery of novel risk genes and pathways for AD. Objective: To search for rare variants contributing to the risk for EOAD. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this case-control study, whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed in 51 non-Hispanic white (NHW) patients with EOAD  (age at onset <65 years) and 19 Caribbean Hispanic families previously screened as negative for established APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 causal variants. Participants were recruited from John P. Hussman Institute for Human Genomics, Case Western Reserve University, and Columbia University. Rare, deleterious, nonsynonymous, or loss-of-function variants were filtered to identify variants in known and suspected AD genes, variants in multiple unrelated NHW patients, variants present in 19 Hispanic EOAD WES families, and genes with variants in multiple unrelated NHW patients. These variants/genes were tested for association in an independent  cohort of 1524 patients with EOAD, 7046 patients with late-onset AD (LOAD), and 7001 cognitively intact controls (age at examination, >65 years) from the Alzheimers Disease Genetics Consortium. The study was conducted from January 21, 2013, to October 13, 2016. Main Outcomes and Measures: Alzheimer disease diagnosed according to standard National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria. Association between Alzheimer disease and genetic variants and genes was measured using logistic regression and sequence kernel association test-optimal gene tests, respectively. Results: Of the 1524 NHW patients with EOAD, 765 (50.2%) were women and mean (SD) age was 60.0 (4.9) years; of the 7046 NHW patients with LOAD, 4171 (59.2%) were women and mean (SD) age was 77.4 (8.6) years; and of the 7001 NHW controls, 4215  (60.2%) were women and mean (SD) age was 77.4 (8.6) years. The gene PSD2, for which multiple unrelated NHW cases had rare missense variants, was significantly  associated with EOAD (P?=?2.05?×?10-6; Bonferroni-corrected P value [BP]?=?1.3?×?10-3) and LOAD (P?=?6.22?×?10-6; BP?=?4.1?×?10-3). A missense variant in TCIRG1, present in a NHW patient and segregating in 3 cases of a Hispanic family, was more frequent in EOAD cases (odds ratio [OR], 2.13; 95% CI,  0.99-4.55; P?=?.06; BP?=?0.413), and significantly associated with LOAD (OR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.37-3.62; P?=?7.2?×?10-4; BP?=?5.0?×?10-3). A missense variant in  the LOAD risk gene RIN3 showed suggestive evidence of association with EOAD after Bonferroni correction (OR, 4.56; 95% CI, 1.26-16.48; P?=?.02, BP?=?0.091). In addition, a missense variant in RUFY1 identified in 2 NHW EOAD cases showed suggestive evidence of an association with EOAD as well (OR, 18.63; 95% CI, 1.62-213.45; P?=?.003; BP?=?0.129). Conclusions and Relevance: The genes PSD2, TCIRG1, RIN3, and RUFY1 all may be involved in endolysosomal transport-a process known to be important to development of AD.

      "[CLS] Reticulon proteins (RTNs), consisting of RTN1 to RTN4, were previously shown to interact with BACE1 by negatively modulating its secretase activity. In RTN3-null mice, RTN1 expression was slightly elevated. To understand the in vivo role of RTN1, we generated RTN1-null mice and compared the effects of RTN1 and RTN3 on BACE1 modulation. We show that RTN1 is mostly expressed by neurons and not by glial cells under normal conditions, similar to the expression of RTN3. However,  RTN1 is more localized in dendrites and is an excellent marker for dendrites of Purkinje cells, while RTN3 expression is less evident in dendrites. This differential localization also correlates with their associations with amyloid plaques in [MASK] brains: RTN3, but not RTN1, is abundantly enriched in dystrophic neurites. RTN3 deficiency causes elevation of BACE1 protein levels, while RTN1 deficiency shows no obvious effects on BACE1 activity due to compensation by RTN3, as RTN1 deficiency causes elevation of RTN3 expression. Hence, expression of RTN1 and RTN3 is tightly regulated in mouse brains. Together, our data show that RTN1 and RTN3 have differential effects on the formation of senile plaques in [MASK] brains and that RTN3 has a more prominent role in [MASK] pathogenesis.

To date, studies of its impact [MASK] focused on return of Mendelian risk information, principally hereditary cancer syndromes.MethodsIn a multisite trial  of Alzheimer disease genetic risk disclosure, asymptomatic adults were randomized to receive test results in person or via telephone. Primary analyses examined patient outcomes 12 months after disclosure.ResultsData from 257 participants showed that telephone disclosure occurred 7.4 days sooner and was 30% shorter, on average, than in-person disclosure (both P?<?0.001). Anxiety and depression scores were well below cutoffs for clinical concern across protocols. Comparing telephone and in-person disclosure protocols, 99% confidence intervals of mean differences were within noninferiority margins on scales assessing anxiety, depression, and test-related distress, but inconclusive about positive impact. No differences were observed on measures of recall and subjective impact. Subanalyses supported noninferiority on all outcomes among apolipoprotein E (APOE) ?4-negative participants. Subanalyses were inconclusive for APOE ?4-positive participants, although mean anxiety and depression scores were still  well below cutoffs for clinical concern.ConclusionTelephone disclosure of APOE results and risk for Alzheimer disease is generally safe and helps providers meet demands for services, even when results identify an increased risk for disease.

      "[CLS] The causes of late-onset Alzheimers disease are unclear and likely multifactorial. Rho-associated protein kinases (ROCKs) are ubiquitously expressed signaling messengers that mediate a wide array of cellular processes. Interestingly, they play an important role in several vascular and brain pathologies implicated in Alzheimers etiology, including hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, blood-brain barrier disruption, oxidative stress, deposition of vascular and parenchymal amyloid-beta peptides, tau hyperphosphorylation, and cognitive decline. The current review summarizes the functions of ROCKs with respect to the various risk factors and pathologies on both sides of the blood-brain barrier and present support for targeting ROCK signaling as a multifactorial and multi-effect [MASK] for the prevention and amelioration of late-onset Alzheimers disease.

      "[CLS] Amyloid ß (Aß) peptides generated from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) play an important role in the degeneration of neurons and development of Alzheimers disease (AD). Current evidence indicates that high levels of cholesterol-which increase the risk of developing AD-can influence Aß production in neurons. However, it remains unclear how altered level/subcellular distribution of cholesterol in astrocytes can influence APP metabolism. In this study, we evaluated the effects of cholesterol transport inhibitor U18666A-a class II amphiphile that triggers redistribution of cholesterol within the endosomal-lysosomal ([MASK]) system-on APP levels and metabolism in rat primary cultured astrocytes. Our results revealed that U18666A increased the levels of the APP holoprotein and its cleaved products (a-/ß-/?-CTFs) in cultured astrocytes, without altering the total levels of cholesterol or cell viability. The cellular levels of Aß1-40 were also found to be markedly increased, while secretory levels of Aß1-40 were decreased in U18666A-treated astrocytes. We further report a corresponding increase in the activity of the enzymes regulating APP processing, such as a-secretase, ß-secretase, and ?-secretase as a consequence of U18666A treatment. Additionally, APP-cleaved products are partly accumulated in the lysosomes following cholesterol sequestration within [MASK] system possibly due to decreased clearance. Interestingly, serum delipidation attenuated enhanced levels of APP and its cleaved products following U18666A treatment. Collectively, these results suggest that cholesterol sequestration within the [MASK]  system in astrocytes can influence APP metabolism and the accumulation of APP-cleaved products including Aß peptides, which can contribute to the development of AD pathology.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Melatonin is a molecule with numerous properties applicable to the treatment of neurological diseases. Among these properties are the following: potent scavenger of oxygen and nitrogen reactive species, anti-inflammatory features, immuno-enhancing nature, and modulation of circadian rhythmicity. Furthermore, low concentrations of melatonin are usually found in patients with neurological diseases and mental disorders. The positive results obtained in experimental models of diverse pathologies, [MASK] diseases of the nervous system (e.g., Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntingtons disease, epilepsy, headaches, etc.) as well as mental and behavioural disordes (e.g., autism spectrum disorders, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorders, etc.), have served as a basis for the  design of clinical trials to study melatonins possible usefulness in human pathology, although the satisfactory results obtained from the laboratory \"bench\" are not always applicable to the patients \"bedside\". OBJECTIVE: In this article, we review those papers describing the results of the  administration of melatonin to humans for various therapeutic purposes in the field of neuropathology. CONCLUSION: Clinical trials with strong methodologies and appropriate doses of melatonin are necessary to support or reject the usefulness of melatonin in neurological diseases.

      "[CLS] Monitoring effects of disease or therapeutic intervention on brain function is increasingly important [MASK] clinical trials, albeit hampered by inter-individual variability and subtle effects. Here, we apply complementary biomarker algorithms to electroencephalography (EEG) recordings to capture the brains multi-faceted signature of disease or pharmacological intervention and use machine learning to  improve classification per[MASK]mance. Using data from healthy subjects receiving scopolamine we developed an index of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist (mAChR) consisting of 14 EEG biomarkers. This mAChR index yielded higher classification per[MASK]mance than any single EEG biomarker with cross-validated accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and precision ranging from 88-92%. The mAChR index also discriminated healthy elderly from patients with Alzheimers disease (AD); however, an index optimized [MASK] AD pathophysiology provided a better classification. We conclude that integrating multiple EEG biomarkers can enhance the accuracy of identifying disease or drug interventions, which is essential [MASK] clinical trials. [SEP]\t\tfor\n",

      "[CLS] Alzheimers disease (AD) is a major international health and economic concern. A  key pathological feature of AD is so-called \"amyloid-ß-plaques\", or \"Aß-plaques\", which are deposits of aggregated protein, enriched with the Aß fragment of amyloid precursor protein. Despite their name, the deposits are not pure Aß and have a heterogeneous, chemically complex composition that can include multiple proteins, lipids, and metal ions (Fe, Cu, or Zn). Despite extensive research, it  is still uncertain whether Aß-plaques are a cause or a consequence of AD pathology. Further characterization of the elemental and biochemical composition  within and surrounding Aß-plaques, and knowledge of how composition varies with disease state or progression, may provide important insight into the relationship between Aß-plaques and AD pathology. With this aim in mind, herein we demonstrate a multimodal spectroscopic imaging workflow to better characterize the complex composition of Aß-plaques. Our approach incorporates several spectroscopic imaging techniques, such as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic imaging (FTIR), Raman microscopy, and X-ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM). While FTIR, Raman, and XFM have been used previously, [MASK] in isolation, to study Aß-plaques, application of all three techniques, in combination with histology and fluorescence microscopy, has not been reported previously. We demonstrate that a multimodal workflow, incorporating all three methods on adjacent or serial tissue sections, can reveal substantial complementary information about the biochemical and elemental composition of Aß-plaques. Information revealed by the  method includes the relative content and distribution of aggregated protein, total lipid, lipid esters, cholesterol, and metals (Fe, Cu, or Zn). [SEP]\t\tmostly\n",

      "[CLS] Although several studies have shown that type-2 cannabinoid receptor (CB2R) is involved in Alzheimers disease (AD) pathology, the effects of CB2R on AD-like [MASK] abnormal phosphorylation and its underlying mechanism remain unclear. Herein, we employed the CB2R-/- mice as the animal model to explore roles of CB2R in regulating [MASK] phosphorylation and brain function. We found that CB2R-/- mice display AD-like [MASK] hyperphosphorylation, hippocampus-dependent memory impairment, increase of GSK3ß activity, decrease of AMPK and Sirt1 activity and mitochondria dysfunction. Interestingly, AICAR or resveratrol (AMPK agonist) could efficiently rescue most alternations caused by solo deletion of CB2R in CB2R-/- mice. Moreover, JWH133, a selective agonist of CB2R, reduces phosphorylation of [MASK] and GSK3ß activity in HEK293 [MASK] cells, but the effects of JWH133 on phosphorylation of [MASK] and GSK3ß disappeared while blocking AMPK activity with compound C or Prkaa2-RNAi. Taken together, our study indicated that deletion of CB2R induces behavior damage and AD-like pathological alternation via AMPK/GSK3ß pathway. These findings proved that CB2R/AMPK/GSK3ß pathway can be a promising new drug target for AD. [SEP]\t\ttau\n",

      "[CLS] The need for a reliable, simple, and inexpensive blood test for Alzheimers disease (AD) suitable for use in a primary care setting is widely recognized. This has led to a large number of publications describing blood tests for AD, which have, for the most part, not been replicable. We have chosen to [MASK] transcripts expressed by the cellular, leukocyte compartment of blood. We have used hypothesis-based cDNA arrays and quantitative PCR to quantify the expression of selected sets of genes followed by multivariate analyses in multiple independent samples. Rather than a single study with no replicates, we chose an experimental design in which there were multiple replicates using different platforms and different sample populations. We have divided 177 blood samples and 27 brain samples into multiple replicates to demonstrate the ability to distinguish early clinical AD (Clinical Dementia Rating scale 0.5), Parkinsons disease (PD), and cognitively unimpaired APOE4 homozygotes, as well as to determine persons at risk for future cognitive impairment with significant accuracy. We assess our methods in a training/test set and also show that the variables we use distinguish AD, PD, and control brain. Importantly, we describe  the variability of the weights assigned to individual transcripts in multivariate analyses in repeated studies and suggest that the variability we describe may be  the cause of inability to repeat many earlier studies. Our data constitute a proof of principle that multivariate analysis of the transcriptome related to cell stress and inflammation of peripheral blood leukocytes has significant potential as a minimally invasive and inexpensive diagnostic tool for diagnosis and early detection of risk for AD.

      "[CLS] Alzheimers Disease (AD) is one of the most common forms of dementia in elderly people. To date, efficacious therapeutic agent for the treatment of AD is still very limited, so it has long been a challenging and attractive task to discover new anti-AD drugs. Considering the multifactorial nature of AD, recently, the concept of Multi-Target-Directed Ligands (MTDLs) has [MASK] as a new strategy for designing therapeutic agents on AD. MTDLs are believed to exert their effects through simultaneously affecting multiple targets which contribute to etiology of AD. Therefore, MTDLs are considered to be more efficacious than mono-target agents. Tacrine is the first drug approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Although the clinical use of tacrine is restricted because of its hepatotoxicity, the high Ligand Efficiency (LE) of this compound makes it an ideal component for  designing MTDLs. This article provides an update review of the advances on the development of MTDLs based on tacrine. Case studies are carefully selected to show the detailed strategy on medicinal modification of Tacrine-Based MTDLs. Finally, several concerns and opinions on designing new MTDLs are discussed as well. [SEP]\t\temerged\n",

      "[CLS] Current experimental evidence points to the conclusion that aquaporin 4 (AQP4), which is an important [MASK] membrane protein found in the brain, could play major roles in various brain conditions pathologically including pathogenesis of Alzheimers disease (AD). In this paper, we review how AQP4 and altered astrocyte functions interact in AD, and provide experimental evidence highlighting the importance of this topic for the future investigations. The interactions of AQP4 are as follows: (i) AQP4 could influence astrocytic calcium  signaling and potassium homeostasis. (ii) AQP4 is linked with the removal of interstitial ß-amyloid and glutamate transmission. (iii) Furthermore, AQP4 modulates the reactive astrogliosis and neuroinflammation mechanisms. (iv) To add to this, AQP4 could participate in the AD pathogenesis through affecting neurotrophic factor production. It is therefore possible to identify certain functional molecules that regulate astrocyte make-up and functions. However, making crucial efforts to develop specific agents or drugs that target AQP4 function and test their therapeutic efficiency will be a breakthrough for addressing AD in that AQP4 controls the various physiological as well as pathophysiological features of astrocytes.

      "[CLS] INTRODUCTION: For nearly 50 years, institutional review boards (IRB) and independent ethics committees have featured local oversight as a core function of research ethics reviews. However growing complexity in Alzheimers clinical research suggests current approaches to research volunteer safety is hampering development of new therapeutics. As a partial response to this challenge, the NIH has mandated that all NIH-funded multi-site studies will use a single Institutional Review Board. The perspective describes a joint program to provide  a single IRB of record (sIRB) for phases of multi-site studies. METHODS: The approach follows two steps. One, an expert Scientific Review Committee (SRC) of senior researchers in the field will conduct the review principally of scientific merit, significance, feasibility, and the likelihood of meaningful results. The second step will be the IRBs regulatory and ethics review. The IRB will apply appropriate regulatory criteria for approval including minimization of risks to subjects and risks reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, equitable subject selection, informed consent, protections for vulnerable populations, and application of local context considerations, among others. RESULTS: There is a steady demand for scientific, ethical and regulatory review of planned Alzheimers studies. As of January 15, 2017, there are nearly 400 open studies, Phase II and III, industry and NIH sponsored trials on disease indications affecting memory, movement and mood in the US.

      "[CLS] Alzheimers disease is an age-related, neurodegenerative disorder, characterized  by cognitive impairment and restrictions in activities of daily living. This disease is the most common form of dementia with complex multifactorial pathological mechanisms. Many therapeutic approaches have been proposed. Among them, inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, and prolyl oligopeptidase can be beneficial targets in the treatment of Alzheimers disease. Roots, along with aerial parts of Argemone platyceras, [MASK] extracted with ethanol and fractionated on an alumina column using light petrol, chloroform and  ethanol. Subsequently, repeated preparative thin-layer chromatography led to the  isolation of (+)-laudanosine, protopine, (-)-argemonine, allocryptopine, (-)-platycerine, (-)-munitagine, and (-)-norargemonine belonging to pavine, protopine and benzyltetrahydroisoquinoline structural types. Chemical structures  of the isolated alkaloids [MASK] elucidated by optical rotation, spectroscopic and  spectrometric analysis (NMR, MS), and comparison with literature data. (+)-Laudanosine was isolated from A. platyceras for the first time. Isolated compounds [MASK] tested for human blood acetylcholinesterase, human plasma butyrylcholinesterase and recombinant prolyl oligopeptidase inhibitory activity.  The alkaloids inhibited the enzymes in a dose-dependent manner. The most active compound (-)-munitagine, a pavine alkaloid, inhibited both acetylcholinesterase and prolyl oligopeptidase with IC50 values of 62.3 ± 5.8 µM and 277.0 ± 31.3 µM,  respectively.

      "[CLS] The challenge of understanding the biology of neuronal amyloid processing could provide a basis for understanding the amyloid pathology in Alzheimers disease (A[MASK]). Based on our previous studies, we have suggested that A[MASK] might be the consequence of a hormonal imbalance in which the critical hormone is vitamin [MASK]. The present study primarily focused on the creation of a condition that prevents  the genomic or nongenomic action of vitamin [MASK] by disrupting vitamin [MASK] receptors (V[MASK]R or P[MASK]IA3/1,25MARRS); the effects of these disruptions on the series of proteins involved in secretases that play a crucial role in amyloid pathology and on amyloid beta (Aß) production in primary cortical neurons were observed. V[MASK]R and P[MASK]IA3/1,25MARRS genes were silenced separately or simultaneously in E16 primary rat cortical neurons. The expression of target genes involved in APP processing, including Presenilin1, Presenilin2, Nicastrin, BACE1, A[MASK]AM10, and APP, was investigated with qRT-PCR and Western blot in this model. 1,25-[MASK]ihydroxyvitamin [MASK]3 treatments were used to verify any transcriptional regulation data gathered from siRNA treatments by determining the mRNA expression of the target genes. Immunofluorescence labeling was used for the verification of silencing experiments and intracellular Aß1-42 production. Extracellular Aß1-42 level was assessed with ELISA. mRNA and protein expression results showed that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin [MASK]3 might affect the transcriptional regulation of the genes involved in APP processing. The intracellular and extracellular Aß1-42 measurements in our study support this suggestion. Consequently, we suggest that  1,25-dihydroxyvitamin [MASK]3 and its receptors are important parts of the amyloid processing pathway in neurons. [SEP]\t\tD\n",

Examination of the steady-state solutions where microglia and astroglia are involved shows that equilibrium conditions are achieved by microglia and astroglia destroying neurons. These findings from this model are in agreement with the results in the literature, where microglia and astroglia are considered  to act as inflammatory cells producing toxins to destroy neurons. In addition, the study also showed that the number ratio of the total astroglial cells to the  total microglial cells increases with the progression of AD.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the association between long-term exposure to air [MASK] and history of anxiety and depression disorders and of medication use (benzodiazepines and antidepressants) in adults living in Barcelona. METHODS: A total of 958 adults (45-74 years old) residents in Barcelona, most of  them having at least one of their parents diagnosed with dementia (86%), and participating in the ALFA (Alzheimer and Families) study, were included. We used  Land Use Regression (LUR) models to estimate long-term residential exposure (period 2009-2014) to PM2.5, PM2.5 absorbance (PM2.5 abs), PM10, PM coarse, NO2 and NOx. Between 2013 and 2014 participants self-reported their history of anxiety and depression disorders and related medication use. The analysis was focused on those participants reporting outcome occurrence from 2009 onwards (until 2014). RESULTS: We observed an increased odds of history of depression disorders with increasing concentrations of all air pollutants [e.g. an increased odds of depression of 2.00 (95% CI; 1.37, 2.93) for each 10µg/m3 NO2 increase]. Such associations were consistent with an increased odds of medication use in relation to higher concentrations of air pollutants [e.g. an increased odds of antidepressants use of 1.23 (1.04, 1.44) for each 20µg/m3 NOx increase]. Associations regarding anxiety disorders did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that increasing long-term exposure to air [MASK]  may increase the odds of depression and the use of antidepressants and benzodiazepines. Further studies are needed to replicate our results and confirm  this association. [SEP]\t\tpollution\n",

      "[CLS] OBJECTIVE: To estimate risks of neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases among  patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ([MASK]) and their families. METHODS: We conducted a register-based nested case-control study during 1990-2013 in Sweden to assess whether patients with [MASK] had higher risks of other neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases before diagnosis. We included 3,648 patients with [MASK] and 36,480 age-, sex-, and county of birth-matched population controls. We further conducted a follow-up study of the cases and controls to assess the risks of other neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases after [MASK] diagnosis. To assess the potential contribution of familial factors, we conducted similar studies for the relatives of patients with [MASK] and their controls. RESULTS: Individuals with previous neurodegenerative or psychiatric diseases had  a 49% increased risk of [MASK] (odds ratio 1.49, 95% confidence interval 1.35-1.66)  compared to individuals without these diseases. After diagnosis, patients with [MASK] had increased risks of other neurodegenerative or psychiatric diseases (hazard ratio 2.90, 95% confidence interval 2.46-3.43) compared to individuals without [MASK]. The strongest associations were noted for frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson disease, other dementia, Alzheimer disease, neurotic disorders, depression, stress-related disorders, and drug abuse/dependence. First-degree relatives of patients with [MASK] had higher risk of neurodegenerative diseases, whereas only children of patients with [MASK] had higher risk of psychiatric disorders, compared to relatives of the controls. CONCLUSIONS: Familial aggregation of [MASK] and other neurodegenerative diseases implies a shared etiopathogenesis among all neurodegenerative diseases. The increased risk of psychiatric disorders among patients with [MASK] and their children might be attributable to nonmotor symptoms of [MASK] and severe stress response toward the diagnosis.

      "[CLS] The visual photoreceptor rhodopsin is a prototypical G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that stabilizes its inverse agonist ligand, 11-cis-retinal (11CR), by a covalent, protonated Schiff base linkage. In the visual dark adaptation, the fundamental molecular event after photobleaching of rhodopsin is the recombination reaction between its apoprotein opsin and 11CR. Here we present a detailed analysis of the kinetics and thermodynamics of this reaction, also known as the \"regeneration reaction\". We compared the regeneration of purified rhodopsin reconstituted into phospholipid/detergent bicelles with rhodopsin reconstituted into detergent micelles. We found that the lipid bilayer of bicelles stabilized the chromophore-free opsin over the long timescale required for the regeneration experiments, and also facilitated the ligand reuptake binding reaction. We utilized genetic code expansion and site-specific bioorthogonal labeling of rhodopsin with Alexa488 to enable, to our knowledge, a  novel fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based measurement of the binding kinetics between opsin and 11CR. Based on these results, we report a complete energy diagram for the regeneration reaction of rhodopsin. We show that the dissociation reaction of rhodopsin to 11CR and opsin has a 25-pM equilibrium dissociation constant, which corresponds to only 0.3 kcal/mol stabilization compared to the noncovalent, tightly bound antagonist-GPCR complex of iodopindolol and ß-adrenergic receptor. However, 11CR dissociates four orders-of-magnitude slower than iodopindolol, which corresponds to a 6-kcal/mol higher dissociation free energy barrier. We further [MASK] isothermal titration calorimetry to show that ligand binding in rhodopsin is enthalpy driven with -22 kcal/mol, which is 12 kcal/mol more stable than the antagonist-GPCR complex.

      "[CLS] Understanding the pathophysiology of Alzheimers disease (AD) in the principal human neural cells is necessary for finding therapeutics for this illness. To help do this, we have been using freshly cultured functionally normal cerebral cortical adult human astrocytes (NAHAs) and postnatal neurons. The findings show  that amyloid-ß oligomers (Aß-os) binding to calcium-sensing receptors [MASK] on  NAHAs and neuron surfaces trigger signals capable of driving AD pathogenesis. This Aß•CaSR signalling shifts the amyloid precursor protein (APP) from its a-secretase shedding producing neurotrophic/neuroprotective soluble (s)APPa to its ß-secretase cleaving engendering AD-driving Aß42/Aß42-os peptides. Aß•CaSR signalling in NAHAs also drives the release of toxic hyper-phosphorylated Tau proteins in exosomes, and of nitric oxide, and VEGF-A. These several harmful agents comprise the neuron-killing machinery, driving the very slowly spreading AD neurocontagion. VEGF-A over-secretion from Aß-exposed blood vessel-attached astrocytes induces a functional magnetic resonance imaging- detectable hippocampal neoangiogenesis which indicates approaching AD in amnestic minor cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients. Most important in ADs regard, selective allosteric CaSR antagonists (calcylitics) added to Aß42/Aß42-os-exposed NAHAs (or to human neuron cultures) rescue the extracellular shedding of neurotrophic/ neuroprotective sAPPa and suppress all the neurotoxic effects of Aß•CaSR signalling even when multiple microglial cytokines are also present. Therefore, since the multipotent calcilytics would be reasonably safe and inexpensive drugs  for humans, it is worthwhile testing them as AD therapeutics in clinical trials especially in persons in the earliest detectable stages of AD neuropathology progression such as aMCI.

Discussion covered the unmet needs of people with dementia, the domains of daily life activities where assistive technologies can provide help to people with dementia, the enabling and empowering impact of technology to improve their safety and wellbeing, barriers and limits of use, technology assessment, ethical and legal issues.

      "[CLS] The Aß peptide forms extracellular plaques associated with Alzheimers disease. In addition to protein fibrils, amyloid plaques also contain non-proteinaceous components, including glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). We have shown previously that the GAG low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) binds to Aß40 fibrils with a three-fold-symmetric (3Q) morphology with higher affinity than Aß40 fibrils in alternative structures, Aß42 fibrils, or amyloid fibrils formed from other sequences. Solid-state NMR analysis of the GAG-3Q fibril complex revealed an interaction site at the corners of the 3Q fibril structure, but the origin of the binding specificity remained obscure. Here, using a library of short heparin polysaccharides modified at specific sites, we show that the N-sulfate or 6-O-sulfate of glucosamine, but not the 2-O-sulfate of iduronate within heparin is required for 3Q binding, indicating selectivity in the interactions of the GAG with the fibril that extends beyond general electrostatic complementarity. By creating 3Q fibrils containing point substitutions in the amino acid sequence, we also show that [MASK] residues at the fibril three-fold apices provide the majority of the binding free energy, while [MASK] residues elsewhere are less critical for binding. The results indicate, therefore, that LMWH binding to 3Q fibrils requires a precise molecular complementarity of the sulfate moieties on the GAG and [MASK] residues displayed on the fibril surface. Differences in GAG  binding to fibrils with distinct sequence and/or structure may thus contribute to the diverse etiology and progression of amyloid diseases. [SEP]\t\tcharged\n",

METHODS: Antibodies in sera from patients with mild AD [(n?=?91) defined as a Mini-Mental State Examination = 20 or a Clinical Dementia Rating Scale=1] and healthy controls (n?=?102) were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Levels in AD and controls were compared by Mann-Whitney test. In the AD group, associations between antibodies and psychometric test scores were analyzed by robust regression. The false discovery threshold was set to 0.05.

      "[CLS] Alzheimers disease (AD) is characterized by a cascade of pathological processes  that can be assessed in [MASK] using different neuroimaging methods. Recent research suggests a systematic sequence of pathogenic events on a global biomarker level, but little is known about the associations and dependencies of distinct lesion patterns on a regional level. Markov random fields are a probabilistic graphical modeling approach that represent the interaction between  individual random variables by an undirected graph. We propose the novel application of this approach to study the interregional associations and dependencies between multimodal imaging markers of AD pathology and to compare different hypotheses regarding the spread of the disease. We retrieved multimodal imaging data from 577 subjects enrolled in the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Mean amyloid load (AV45-PET), glucose metabolism (FDG-PET), and gray  matter volume (MRI) were calculated for the six principle nodes of the default mode network- a functional network of brain regions that appears to be preferentially targeted by AD. Multimodal Markov random field models were developed for three different hypotheses regarding the spread of the disease: the \"intraregional evolution model\", the \"trans-neuronal spread\" hypothesis, and the  \"wear-and-tear\" hypothesis. The model likelihood to reflect the given data was evaluated using tenfold cross-validation with 1,000 repetitions. The most likely  graph structure contained the posterior cingulate cortex as main hub region with  edges to various other regions, in accordance with the \"wear-and-tear\" hypothesis of disease vulnerability. Probabilistic graphical models facilitate the analysis  of interactions between several variables in a network model and therefore afford great potential to complement traditional multiple regression analyses in multimodal neuroimaging research.

      "[CLS] OBJECTIVE: The highly conserved 14-3-3 proteins interact with key players involved in Parkinsons disease (PD) and other neurodegenerative disorders. We recently demonstrated that 14-3-3 phosphorylation is increased in PD models and that increased 14-3-3 phosphorylation reduces the neuroprotective effects of 14-3-3 proteins. Here, we investigated whether 14-3-3 phosphorylation is altered  in postmortem brains from control, PD, Alzheimers Disease (AD), Alzheimers with Lewy Bodies (ADLB), Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB), and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) subjects at three conserved sites: serine 58 (S58), serine 185 (S185), and serine 232 (S232). METHODS: S58, S185, and S232 phosphorylation was measured by western blot analysis of Triton [MASK] soluble and insoluble fractions from postmortem temporal cortex. RESULTS: The ratio of soluble phospho-S232 to insoluble phospho-S232 was reduced  by 32%, 60%, 37%, and 52% in PD, AD, ADLB, and DLB, respectively. S185 and S58 phosphorylation were mildly elevated in the soluble fraction in DLB. We also noted a dramatic reduction in soluble pan 14-3-3 levels by ~35% in AD, ADLB, and  DLB. Lower ratios of soluble to insoluble S232 phosphorylation (pointing to higher insoluble pS232) correlated with lower soluble pan 14-3-3 levels, suggesting that S232 phosphorylation may promote insolubilization of 14-3-3s. The phospho-S232 ratio and soluble pan 14-3-3 levels correlated with clinical and pathological severity. INTERPRETATION: These data reveal dysregulation of 14-3-3 proteins in neurodegeneration associated with Lewy body or Alzheimer pathology. S232 phosphorylation may drive insolubilization of 14-3-3s and thus contribute to the  pathophysiology in neurodegenerative disorders associated with Lewy body or Alzheimer pathology.

RESULTS: Postcontrast pericortical enhancement was observed in 21 participants (28%), including 6 individuals with Alzheimer disease (40%), 10 with mild cognitive impairment [MASK] and 5 with normal cognition (19%). Pericortical enhancement was positively associated with age (P < .02) and ischemic stroke (P < .05), but not with cognitive status (P = .3). Foci with enhanced signal remained  stable across time in all follow-up cases. The in vitro measurements confirmed that FLAIR imaging is highly sensitive for the detection of low gadolinium concentrations in CSF, but not in cerebral tissue. CONCLUSIONS: Postcontrast pericortical enhancement on FLAIR images occurs in older individuals with normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia. It may represent chronic focal superficial BBB leakage. Future longitudinal studies are needed to determine its clinical significance. [SEP]\t\t(30%),\n",

      "[CLS] The interaction of the intrinsically disordered polypeptide islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), which is associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D), with the Alzheimers disease amyloid-ß (Aß) peptide modulates their self-assembly into amyloid fibrils and may link the pathogeneses of these two cell-degenerative diseases. However, the molecular determinants of this interaction remain elusive. Using a systematic alanine scan approach, fluorescence spectroscopy, and other biophysical methods, including heterocomplex pulldown assays, far-UV CD spectroscopy, the thioflavin T binding assay, transmission EM, and molecular dynamics simulations, here we identified single aromatic/hydrophobic residues within the amyloid core IAPP region as hot spots or key residues of its cross-interaction with Aß40(42) peptide. Importantly, we also find that none of these residues in isolation plays a key role in IAPP self-assembly, whereas simultaneous substitution of four aromatic/hydrophobic residues with Ala dramatically impairs both IAPP self-assembly and hetero-assembly with Aß40(42). Furthermore, our experiments [MASK] several novel IAPP analogs, whose sequences  are highly similar to that of IAPP but have distinct amyloid self- or cross-interaction potentials. The identified similarities and major differences controlling IAPP cross-peptide interaction with Aß40(42) versus its amyloid self-assembly offer a molecular basis for understanding the underlying mechanisms. We propose that these insights will aid in designing intervention strategies and novel IAPP analogs for the management of type 2 diabetes, Alzheimers disease, or other diseases related to IAPP dysfunction or cross-amyloid interactions.

When released, misfolded proteins diffuse in the 3D extracellular [MASK] before binding to the plasma membrane of neighboring cells, where they diffuse on a 2D plane.

      "[CLS] The unfolded protein response (UPR) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the cytoplasmic heat stress response are two major stress response systems necessary  for maintaining proteostasis for cellular health. Failure of either of these systems, such as in sustained UPR activation or in insufficient heat shock response activation, can lead to the development of neurodegeneration. Alleviation of ER stress and enhancement of heat shock response through heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) activation have previously been considered as attractive potential therapeutic targets for Alzheimers disease (AD)-a prevalent and devastating tauopathy. Understanding the interplay of the two aforementioned systems and their cooperative role in AD remain elusive. Here we report studies in human brain and tau pathogenic mouse models (rTg4510, PS19, and rTg21221), identifying HSF1 degradation and UPR activation as precursors of aberrant tau pathogenesis. We demonstrate that chemical ER stress inducers caused autophagy-lysosomal HSF1 degradation, resulting in tau hyperphosphorylation in rat primary neurons. In addition, permanent HSF1 loss reversely causes chronic UPR activation, leading to aberrant tau phosphorylation and aggregation in the hippocampus of aged HSF1 heterozygous knock-out mice. The deleterious interplay of UPR activation and HSF1 loss is exacerbated in N2a [MASK] stably overexpressing a pro-aggregation mutant TauRD ?K280 (N2a-TauRD ?K280). We provide evidence of how these two stress response systems are intrinsically interweaved by showing that the gene encoding C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) activation in the UPR apoptotic pathway facilitates HSF1 degradation, which likely further contributes  to prolonged UPR via ER chaperone HSP70 a5 (BiP/GRP78) suppression. Upregulating  HSF1 relieves the tau toxicity in N2a-TauRD ?K280 by reducing CHOP and increasing HSP70 a5 (BiP/GRP78). Our work reveals how the bidirectional crosstalk between the two stress response systems promotes early tau pathology and identifies HSF1  being one likely key player in both systems.

      "[CLS] INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of Alzheimers disease (AD) continues to rise, while treatment options for cognitive impairment are limited. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) aim to provide symptomatic benefit for cognitive decline, however these drugs are not without adverse events (AEs). The safety profile of each drug must be taken carefully into consideration before being prescribed, as  new dosages and formulations have recently been approved. Areas covered: Donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine are the three AChEIs approved for the treatment of varying stages of AD. Numerous clinical trials and post-marketing studies have evaluated the safety of these medications. This article will review  the safety, efficacy and tolerability of these drugs in treating AD. Topics including pharmacovigilance databases, concomitant drug interactions, prescribing cascades, and treatment discontinuation are also covered. Expert opinion: AChEI use in [MASK] with mild, moderate or severe AD provide modest improvements in cognition, function and behavior. The pharmacological treatment of AD using AChEIs is associated with generally mild AEs. Differences in drug formulations should be taken into account when determining the most appropriate route of administration for each individual.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Alzheimers d[MASK]ease [MASK] a severe neurodegenerative brain d[MASK]order, showing severe beta-amyloid depositions in the brain (plaques) and in vessels (cerebral amyloid angiopathy, CAA), tau pathology, neurodegeneration (and loss of acetylcholine), inflammation with reactive astrocytes and microglia and cerebrovascular damage, all resulting in memory loss. METHODS AND RESULTS: In th[MASK] review, I present a hypothes[MASK] that chronic vascular lesions and bleedings cause platelet overactivation and repair. Platelets express large amounts of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and release beta-amyloid, possibly playing a role as a clotting substance. As the number of bleedings increases over lifetime, the function of platelets dimin[MASK]hes until they are dysfunctional. Dysfunctional processing of APP in platelets and subsequent inflammatory processes may play a role in the formation of CAA. Local lesions and acidos[MASK] may transfer a pathological cascade including silent strokes into the brain, causing irreversible APP dysfunction, tau dysregulation and beta-amyloid deposition. CONCLUSION: Platelets may play a central role in the processing of plaque deposition in the Alzheimer brain and may be of interest for diagnostic as well as therapeutic strategies. [SEP]\t\tis\n",

      "[CLS] To probe individual variations in brain organization, population imaging relates  features of brain images to rich descriptions of the subjects such as genetic information or behavioral and clinical assessments. Capturing common trends across these measurements is important: they jointly characterize the disease status of patient groups. In particular, mapping imaging features to behavioral scores with predictive models opens the way toward more precise diagnosis. Here we propose to jointly predict all the dimensions (behavioral scores) that make up the individual profiles, using so-called multi-output models. This approach often boosts prediction accuracy by capturing latent shared information across scores.  We demonstrate the efficiency of multi-output models on two independent resting-state fMRI datasets targeting different brain disorders (Alzheimers Disease and schizophrenia). Furthermore, the model with joint prediction generalizes much better to a new cohort: a model learned on [MASK] study is more accurately transferred to an independent [MASK]. Finally, we show how multi-output models can easily be extended to multi-modal settings, combining heterogeneous data sources for a better overall accuracy. [SEP]\t\tone\n",

METHODS: A method with all of these characteristics was retrospectively tested in 86 subjects who underwent amyloid (18F-florbetaben) PET/MRI in a clinical setting (using images acquired 90-110 min after injection, 53 were classified visually as amyloid-negative and 33 as amyloid-positive). Early images after tracer administration were acquired between 0 and 10 min after injection, and later images were acquired between 90 and 110 min after injection. PVEC of the PET data was carried out using the geometric transfer matrix method. Parametric images and some regional output parameters, including two innovative \"dual time-point\" [MASK] were obtained. RESULTS: Subjects classified visually as amyloid-positive showed a sparse tracer  uptake in the primary sensory, motor and visual areas in accordance with the isocortical stage of the topographic distribution of the amyloid plaque (Braak stages V/VI). In patients classified visually as amyloid-negative, the method revealed detectable levels of tracer uptake in the basal portions of the frontal  and temporal lobes, areas that are known to be sites of early deposition of amyloid plaques that probably represented early accumulation (Braak stage A) that is typical of normal ageing. There was a strong correlation between age and the indexes of the new dual time-point amyloid imaging method in amyloid-negative patients. CONCLUSIONS: The method can be considered a valuable tool in both routine clinical practice and in the research setting as it will standardize data regarding amyloid deposition. It could potentially also be used to identify early amyloid plaque deposition in younger subjects in whom treatment could theoretically be more effective. [SEP]\t\tindexes,\n",

      "[CLS] Amyloid beta (Aß) deposition is considered to be one of the primary reason to trigger Alzheimers disease (AD). Literature clearly suggests decline in Aß clearance to be accountable for progression of late onset AD as compared to augmented Aß production. There may be several pathways for Aß clearance out of which one of the major pathway is the vascular-mediated removal of Aß from the brain across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) via efflux pumps or receptors. Among Aß scavenger receptors, low density lipoprotein receptor related protein (LRP-1)  has [MASK] most extensively studied. LRP-1, is highly expressed in neurons and located on abluminal side of the brain capillaries whose expression decreases in  AD patients which give rise to increased cerebral Aß deposition.

      "[CLS] Recently, a single study revealed a new complex composed of Toll-like recep[MASK]r 4  (TLR4), TLR6, and CD36 induced by fibrillary Aß peptides, the hallmark of Alzheimers disease. Unlike TLRs located on the plasma membrane that dimerize on  the membrane after ligand binding [MASK] their extracellular domain, the TLR4-TLR6-CD36 complex assembly has been suggested [MASK] be induced by intracellular signals from CD36, similar [MASK] integrin inside-out signaling. However, the assembly site of TLR4-TLR6-CD36 and the domains participating in Aß-induced signaling is still unknown. By interfering with TLR4-TLR6 dimerization using a TLR4-derived peptide, we show that recep[MASK]r assembly is abrogated within the plasma membrane. Furthermore, we reveal that the transmembrane domains of TLR4 and TLR6 have an essential role in recep[MASK]r dimerization and activation. Inhibition of TLR4-TLR6 assembly was associated with reduced secretion of proinflamma[MASK]ry media[MASK]rs from microglia cells, ultimately rescuing neurons from  death. Our findings support TLR4-TLR6 dimerization induced by Aß. Moreover, we shed new light on TLR4-TLR6 assembly and localization and show the potential of inhibiting TLR4-TLR6 dimerization as a treatment of Alzheimers disease. [SEP]\t\tto\n",

      "[CLS] Cytochrome P450 46A1 ([MASK] or cholesterol 24-hydroxylase) controls cholesterol elimination from the brain and plays a role in higher order brain functions. Genetically enhanced [MASK] expression in mouse models of Alzheimers disease mitigates the manifestations of this disease. We enhanced [MASK] activity pharmacologically by treating 5XFAD mice, a model of rapid amyloidogenesis, with  a low dose of the anti-HIV medication efavirenz. Efavirenz was administered from  1 to 9 months of age, and mice were evaluated at specific time points. At one month of age, cholesterol homeostasis was already disturbed in the brain of 5XFAD mice. Nevertheless, efavirenz activated [MASK] and mouse cerebral cholesterol turnover during the first four months of administration. This treatment time also reduced amyloid burden and microglia activation in the cortex and subiculum of 5XFAD mice as well as protein levels of amyloid precursor protein and the expression of several genes involved in inflammatory response. However, mouse short-term memory and long-term spatial memory were impaired, whereas learning in the context-dependent fear test was improved. Additional four months of drug administration (a total of eight months of treatment) improved long-term spatial  memory in the treated as compared to the untreated mice, further decreased amyloid-ß content in 5XFAD brain, and also decreased the mortality rate among male mice. We propose a mechanistic model unifying the observed efavirenz effects. We suggest that [MASK] activation by efavirenz could be a new anti-Alzheimers disease treatment and a tool to study and identify normal and pathological brain processes affected by cholesterol maintenance.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: The use of neurotrophic factors to treat Alzheimers disease (AD) is  hindered by their blood-brain barrier impermeability, short half-life, and severe side effects. Peptide 021 (P021) is a neurotrophic/neurogenic tetra-peptide that  was derived from the most active region of the ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) by epitope mapping. Admantylated glycine was added to its C-terminal to increase  its blood-brain barrier permeability and decrease its degradation by exopeptidases to make it druggable. Here, we report on the preventive effect of P021 in 3?×?Tg-AD, a transgenic mouse model of AD. METHODS: P021 was administered in the diet at 3 months, i.e., 6-9 months before any overt amyloid beta (Aß) or tau pathology, and during the period of synaptic compensation, and was continued until 21 months in 3?×?Tg-AD mice. The 3?×?Tg-AD  mice and wild-type (WT) mice were treated identically but with a vehicle-only diet serving as controls. The effects of P021 on neurogenesis, dendritic and synaptic markers, and cognitive performance were investigated. RESULTS: We found that P021 treatment was able to rescue dendritic and synaptic [MASK] boost neurogenesis, and reverse cognitive impairment in 3?×?Tg-AD mice. CONCLUSIONS: Availability of appropriate neurotrophic support during the period of synaptic compensation can prevent synaptic deficit and cognitive impairment, and P021 is a promising neurotrophic compound for this purpose.

      "[CLS] Decreased clearance of potentially toxic metabolites, due to aging changes, likely plays a significant role in the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aß) peptides and other macromolecules in the brain of the elderly and in the patients with Alzheimers disease (AD). Aging is the single most important risk factor for AD development. Aß transport receptor proteins expressed at the blood-brain barrier  are significantly altered with age: the efflux transporters lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 and P-glycoprotein are reduced, whereas the influx transporter receptor for advanced glycation end products is increased. These receptors play an important role in maintaining brain [MASK] homeostasis. We now report that, in a rat model of aging, gene transcription is altered in aging, as measured by Aß receptor gene messenger RNA (mRNA) at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 20, 30,  and 36 months. Gene mRNA expression from isolated cerebral microvessels was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Lipoprotein receptor-related  protein 1 and P-glycoprotein mRNA were significantly reduced in aging, and receptor for advanced glycation end products was increased, in parallel with the  changes seen in receptor protein expression. Transcriptional changes appear to play a role in aging alterations in blood-brain barrier receptor expression and Aß accumulation. [SEP]\t\tbiochemical\n",

      "[CLS] Datasets comprising simultaneous measurements of many essential metals in Alzheimers disease (AD) brain are sparse, and available studies are not entirely in agreement. To further elucidate this matter, we employed inductively-coupled-plasma mass spectrometry to measure post-mortem levels of 8 essential metals and selenium, in 7 brain regions from 9 cases with AD (neuropathological severity Braak IV-VI), and 13 controls who had normal ante-mortem mental function and no evidence of brain disease. Of the regions studied, three undergo severe neuronal damage in AD (hippocampus, entorhinal cortex and middle-temporal gyrus); three are less-severely affected (sensory cortex, motor cortex and cingulate gyrus); and one (cerebellum) is relatively spared. Metal concentrations in the controls differed among brain regions, and AD-associated perturbations in most metals occurred in only a few: regions more severely affected by neurodegeneration generally showed alterations in more metals, and cerebellum displayed a distinctive pattern. By contrast, copper levels were substantively decreased in all AD-brain regions, to 52.8-70.2% of corresponding control [MASK], consistent with pan-cerebral copper deficiency. This copper deficiency could be pathogenic in AD, since levels are lowered to [MASK] approximating those in Menkes disease, an X-linked recessive disorder where brain-copper deficiency is the accepted cause of severe brain damage.

Remarkably, the cyclic neuroendocrine peptide somatostatin-14 (SST14) was observed to be the most selectively enriched oAß1-42 binder. The binding interface comprises a central tryptophan within SST14 and the N-terminus  of Aß1-42.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Recent experiments with Amyloid ß1-42 peptide have indicated that the initial dimerization of Aß1-42 monomers to form amyloid dimers stand out as a key event in the generation of toxic oligomers. However, the structural characterization of Aß1-42 dimer at the atomistic level and the dimerization mechanism by which Aß1-42 peptides co-aggregate still [MASK] not clear. OBJECTIVE: In the present study, the process of Aß17-42 peptide dimerization which is known to play an important role in the plaque formation in Alzheimers disease was evaluated in terms of potential of mean force. METHODS: The Aß17-42 dimer was constructed using PatchDock server. We have used molecular dynamics (MD) simulation with the umbrella sampling methodology to compute the Potential of Mean Force for the dimerization of Aß17-42. The global minima structure at the minimum distance of separation was isolated from the calculated free energy profile and the interactions involved in the formation of  the dimer structure were examined. Protein-protein interfaces and the residueresidue interactions vital for generation of the dimer complexes were also evaluated. RESULTS: The simulation results elucidated the interaction between the monomeric  units to be governed primarily by the hydrophobic and hydrogen bonds. The resultant Aß17-42 dimer was found to have an increased ß-strands propensity at the hydrophobic regions encompassing the CHC region. Furthermore, specific hydrophobic residues were found to play a vital role in the formation of the dimer complex.

Molecular docking results show that the inhibitory effect of the ß-casein may be due to binding of the chaperone with the aggregation-prone region of the Aß1-42 mainly via hydrophobic interactions. ß-Casein probably binds to the CHC and C-terminal domain of the Aß1-42, and stabilizes proteins by inhibiting the conversion of monomeric Aß1-42 into fibrils.

To select sub-efficacious doses of both  drugs, dose-response studies were first performed on the scopolamine-induced deficits of spontaneous alternation in the Y-maze task and of acquisition and retrieval processes in a passive avoidance task. RESULT: For spontaneous alternation behavior, combination of 1 mg/kg galantamine  and 0.5 mg/kg RS-67333 fully reversed the deficit. In the passive avoidance task, no sub-efficacious doses could be found in the retention paradigm, but a beneficial effect of the association has been demonstrated in the acquisition paradigm.

Transcribed interviews were stored in Nvivo® . Grounded theory procedures  of memo writing, open coding, constant comparison, and focused coding were used to derive conceptual themes. RESULTS: Eighteen dyads were interviewed. The overarching themes surrounding diagnosis benefits and drawbacks were as follows: (1) emotional impact of the diagnosis; (2) practical benefits and limitations of the diagnosis, in terms of (a) understanding ones symptoms and (b) access to clinical support. Although participants were glad to have clinical support in place, they expressed frustration at the lack of clarity, and the lack of available treatments for MCI. Consequently, living [MASK] MCI can be characterized as an ambivalent experience. CONCLUSION: As a clinical label, MCI appears to have little explanatory power for people living [MASK] cognitive difficulties. Work is needed to clarify how clinicians and patients communicate about MCI, and how people can be helped to live well [MASK] the label. Despite an emerging body of prognostic studies, people  [MASK] MCI are likely to continue living [MASK] significant uncertainty. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Mild cognitive impairment is  a state of cognitive decline between normal cognitive ageing and dementia. This clinical category has been an important domain of academic debate over recent years. From a clinical perspective, diagnosing MCI is a helpful way to enable communication between health professionals, and a diagnosis can be important for  patients in need of support and education. However, diagnosis can be fraught [MASK] difficulties, while patients have reported significant uncertainty about the label. This study aimed to examine the perceived benefits and drawbacks of receiving a MCI diagnosis. What does this study add? The emotional impact of a MCI diagnosis is complex and raised conflicting and fluctuating emotions in our participants accounts - most notably worry and relief. Participants were glad to have clinical support available to call on; however, they were frustrated at the  lack of treatments available for MCI and were often anxious to slow any cognitive decline down Health psychologists will have an important role to play in understanding and improving clinical communication about MCI.

      "[CLS] INTRODUCTION: The mechanism triggering degeneration in Alzheimers disease (AD) remains uncertain. Therapeutic failure following amyloid ß (Aß) removal casts doubt on amyloid neurotoxicity per se as the primary cause of AD. Impaired microvascular function has been suggested as an alternative etiology. People with Down syndrome (DS) develop Alzheimers pathology, but whether microvascular impairment also occurs in DS (as in AD) is unknown. METHODS: We examined brain microvasculature in five DS subjects with AD-type histopathology, seven AD cases, and seven controls without AD-type pathology. We  counted microvessels in five anatomic regions and assessed endothelial integrity  by CD31 immunohistochemistry. [MASK] Microvascular numbers and endothelial integrity were significantly diminished in DS brains compared with controls and were similar to AD brains. DISCUSSION: People with DS and trisomy 21 produce a large amount of Aß. If Alzheimers pathology occurred in DS without microvascular loss or endothelial impairment, a direct neurotoxic Aß mechanism would be supported and microvascular impairment rejected. The observation of microvascular impairment in DS with Alzheimers disease changes fails to reject the microvascular hypothesis and provides some support for this potential mechanism of injury.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND/AIMS: Whether age at onset influences functional deterioration in Alzheimer disease (AD) is unclear. We, therefore, investigated risk factors for progression in activities of daily living (ADL) and nursing home placement (NHP)  in cholinesterase inhibitor (ChEI)-treated patients with early-onset AD (EOAD) versus late-onset AD (LOAD). METHODS: This 3-year, prospective, observational, multicenter study included 1,017 participants with mild-to-moderate AD; 143 had EOAD (onset <65 years) and 874 LOAD (onset =65 years). Possible sociodemographic and clinical factors that could affect functional outcome and NHP were analyzed using mixed-effects models  and logistic regression, respectively. RESULTS: Younger individuals exhibited longer illness duration before AD diagnosis, whereas 6-month functional response to ChEI therapy, 3-year changes in ADL capacities, time from diagnosis to NHP, and survival time in nursing homes were similar between the groups. In LOAD, a higher ChEI dose, no antidepressant use, and lower education level were protective factors for slower instrumental ADL (IADL) decline. In EOAD, antihypertensives/cardiac therapy [MASK] faster IADL progression but lower risk of NHP. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the clinical importance of an earlier diagnosis and treatment initiation and the need for functional evaluations in EOAD. Despite the age differences between EOAD and LOAD, a similar need for nursing homes was observed. [SEP]\t\timplied\n",

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: There is currently no disease-modifying treatment available to halt or delay the progression of the disease pathology in dementia. An agreed [MASK] set of the best-available and most appropriate outcomes for disease modification would facilitate the design of trials and ensure consistency across disease modification trials, as well as making results comparable and meta-analysable in  future trials. OBJECTIVES: To agree a set of [MASK] outcomes for disease modification trials for mild to moderate dementia with the UK dementia research community and patient and public involvement (PPI). DATA SOURCES: We included disease modification trials with quantitative outcomes  of efficacy from (1) references from related systematic reviews in workstream 1;  (2) searches of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group study register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, EMBASE, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature and PsycINFO on 11 December 2015, and clinical trial registries [International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) and clinicaltrials.gov] on 22 and 29 January 2016; and (3) hand-searches of reference lists of relevant systematic reviews from database searches. REVIEW METHODS: The project consisted of four workstreams. (1) We obtained related [MASK] outcome sets and work from co-applicants. (2) We systematically reviewed published and ongoing disease modification trials to identify the outcomes used in different domains. We extracted outcomes used in each trial, recording how many used each outcome and with how many participants. We divided outcomes into the domains measured and searched for validation data. (3) We consulted with PPI participants about recommended outcomes. (4) We presented all  the synthesised information at a conference attended by the wider body of National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) dementia researchers to reach consensus on a [MASK] set of outcomes. RESULTS: We included 149 papers from the 22,918 papers screened, referring to 125 individual trials. Eighty-one outcomes were used across trials, including 72 scales [31 cognitive, 12 activities of daily living (ADLs), 10 global, 16 neuropsychiatric and three quality of life] and nine biological techniques. We consulted with 18 people for PPI. The conference decided that only cognition and  biological markers are [MASK] measures of disease modification. Cognition should be measured by the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) or the Alzheimers Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog), and brain changes through structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a subset of participants. All other domains are important but not [MASK]. We recommend using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory for neuropsychiatric symptoms: the Disability Assessment for Dementia for ADLs, the Dementia Quality of Life Measure for quality of life and the Clinical Dementia Rating scale to measure dementia globally. LIMITATIONS: Most of the trials included participants with Alzheimers disease, so recommendations may not apply to other types of dementia. We did not conduct economic analyses. The PPI consultation was limited to members of the Alzheimers Society Research Network. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive outcomes and biological markers form the [MASK] outcome set  for future disease modification trials, measured by the MMSE or ADAS-Cog, and structural MRI in a subset of participants. FUTURE WORK: We envisage that the [MASK] set may be superseded in the future, particularly for other types of dementia. There is a need to develop an algorithm to compare s[MASK]s on the MMSE and ADAS-Cog. STUDY REGISTRATION: The project was registered with Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials [ www.comet-initiative.org/studies/details/819?result=true (accessed 7 April 2016)].

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Psychotropic medications are widely prescribed to manage neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) of Alzheimers disease (AD). Our objective was to [MASK] the longitudinal associations between psychotropic medication use and NPS, cognition, and functional performance in persons with very mild or mild AD at baseline. METHODS: Data were collected as part of the prospective three-year study of home-dwelling persons with AD and their caregivers (n = 236 dyads). The associations between psychotropic medication use and clinical measures were analyzed using repeated measures Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) models. NPS, cognition, daily functioning, and disease severity were assessed with NPI, CERAD-NB, or MMSE, ADCS-ADL, and CDR-SOB, respectively. All analyses were adjusted for age, gender, education, and co-morbidities. RESULTS: The prevalence of benzodiazepines and related medications increased from 16% to 24% (p = 0.031), antidepressants from 11% to 18% (p = 0.057), and antipsychotics from 4% to 16% (p = 0.011) in the three years following AD diagnosis. In adjusted multivariable analyses, a one-point increase in NPI increased the odds of using any psychotropic medication class by 4% (odds ratio (OR) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.07). ADCS-ADL (1/OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.02-1.06) and CDR-SOB (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.13-1.42) were associated with use of antipsychotics. CERAD-NB and MMSE were not associated with any psychotropic medication class use in the models. CONCLUSIONS: Psychotropic medication use increased significantly in relation to increasing dependency in AD, especially with NPS. Furthermore, the use of antipsychotics increased with disease severity, and with decline in daily functioning. Cognitive performance was not associated with psychotropic medication use.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND/AIMS: Verbal fluency is impaired in patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and primary progressive aphasia (PPA). This study explored qualitative differences in verbal fluency (clustering of words, switching between strategies) between FTD and PPA variants. METHODS: Twenty-nine patients with behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD) and 50 with PPA (13 nonfluent/agrammatic, 14 semantic, and 23 logopenic) performed a semantic and letter fluency task. Clustering (number of multiword strings) and switching (number of transitions between clustered and nonclustered words) were recorded by two independent raters. Between-group differences, associations with memory, language, and executive functioning, and longitudinal change (subsample) in clustering and switching were examined. RESULTS: Interrater reliability was high (median 0.98). PPA patients generated (a) smaller (number of) clusters on semantic and letter fluency than bvFTD patients (p < 0.05). Semantic variant patients used more switches than nonfluent/agrammatic or logopenic variant patients (p < 0.05). Clustering in semantic fluency was significantly associated with memory and language (range standardized regression coefficients 0.24-0.38). Switching in letter fluency was  associated with executive functioning (0.32-0.35). CONCLUSION: Clustering and switching in verbal fluency differed between patients  with subtypes of FTD and PPA. Qualitative aspects of verbal fluency provide additional information on verbal ability and executive [MASK] which can be used  for clinically diagnostic purposes. [SEP]\t\tcontrol\n",

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Drug delivery to the bra[MASK] is a major roadblock to treatment of Alzheimers disease. Recent results of the PRIME study [MASK]dicate that [MASK]creas[MASK]g bra[MASK] penetration of antibody drugs improves Alzheimers treatment outcomes. New  approaches are needed to better accomplish this goal. Based on prior evidence, the hypothesis that glycan modification alters antibody blood-bra[MASK] barrier permeability was tested here. METHODS: The blood-bra[MASK] barrier permeability coefficient Pe of different glycosylated states of anti-amyloid IgG was measured us[MASK]g [MASK] vitro models of bra[MASK] microvascular endothelial cells. Monoclonal antibodies 4G8, with sialic acid, and 6E10, lack[MASK]g sialic acid, were studied. The amount of sialic acid was  determ[MASK]ed us[MASK]g quantitative and semi-quantitative surface plasmon resonance methods. RESULTS: Influx of IgG was not saturable and was largely [MASK]sensitive to IgG species and glycosylation state. By contrast, efflux of 4G8 efflux was significantly lower than both album[MASK] controls and 6E10. Removal of a2,6-l[MASK]ked sialic acid group present on 12% of 4G8 completely restored efflux to that of 6E10 but [MASK]creas[MASK]g the a2,6-sialylated fraction to 15% resulted [MASK] no change. Removal of the Fc glycan from 4G8 partially restored efflux. Alternate sialic acid groups with a2,3 and a2,8 l[MASK]kages, nor on the Fc glycan, were not detected  at significant levels on either 4G8 or 6E10. CONCLUSIONS: These results support a model [MASK] which surface-sialylated 4G8 [MASK]hibits its own efflux and that of asialylated 4G8. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Glycan modification has the potential to [MASK]crease antibody  drug penetration [MASK]to the bra[MASK] through efflux [MASK]hibition. [SEP]\t\tin\n",

      "[CLS] Altered concentrations of monoamine neurotransmitters and metabolites have been repeatedly found in people with Down syndrome (DS, trisomy 21). Because of the limited availability of human post-mortem tissue, DS mouse models are of great interest to study these changes and the underlying neurobiological mechanisms. Although previous studies have shown the potential of Ts65Dn mice - the most widely used mouse model of DS - to model noradrenergic changes, a comprehensive monoaminergic characterization in multiple brain regions has not been performed so far. Here, we used RP-HPLC with electrochemical detection to quantify (nor)adrenergic (NA, adrenaline and MHPG), dopaminergic (DA, HVA and DOPAC), and  serotonergic compounds (tryptophan, 5-HT and 5-HIAA) in ten regionally dissected  brain regions of Ts65Dn mice, as well as in Dp1Tyb mice - a novel DS mouse model. Comparing young [MASK] aneuploid mice (2.5-5.5months) with their euploid WT littermates did not reveal generalized monoaminergic dysregulation, indicating that the genetic overload in these mice barely affected the absolute concentrations at this age. Moreover, we studied the effect of aging in Ts65Dn mice: comparing aged animals (12-13months) with their younger counterparts revealed a large number of significant changes. In general, the (nor)adrenergic system appeared to be reduced, while serotonergic compounds were increased with aging. Dopaminergic alterations were less consistent. These overall patterns appeared to be relatively similar for Ts65Dn and WT mice, though more observed changes were regarded significant for WT mice. Similar human post-mortem studies  are necessary to validate the monoaminergic construct validity of the Ts65Dn and  Dp1Typ mouse models. [SEP]\t\tadult\n",

      "[CLS] Alzheimer disease (AD) is an irreversible, progressive brain disorder that causes slow loss of memory and thinking [MASK] normally leading to death in 3-9 y. The  etiology of AD is not fully understood but is widely believed to be induced by the production and deposition of amyloid-ß peptide in the brain. Recently, a correlation was discovered between amyloid-ß deposition and atherosclerosis in the cerebral arteries of postmortem brains, indicating that amyloid-ß promotes atherogenesis and that in turn atherosclerosis promotes brain amyloid-ß accumulation. However, a direct measurement of arterial stiffness for AD is lacking. In the present study, the pulse wave velocity (PWV) of the carotid artery was measured non-invasively in young (3-mo-old) and middle-aged (9-mo-old) wild-type (WT) and modeled AD mice to obtain quantitative data of arterial stiffness by using a 35-MHz high-frequency dual-element transducer. Experimental  results show that the PWVs were 1.6 ± 0.5 m/s for young and 2.4 ± 0.4 m/s for middle-aged WT mice and 1.7 ± 0.4 m/s for young and 3.2 ± 0.6 m/s for middle-aged AD mice. Middle-aged groups had higher PWVs (p < 0.0001), which were more pronounced in the AD mice (p < 0.001). The differences in PWVs were not caused by arterial lumen diameter, wall thickness or contents of elastin or collagen. These results imply that AD increases the stiffness of the carotid artery and introduce ultrasound as a potential tool for AD research and diagnosis. [SEP]\t\tskills,\n",

      "[CLS] Presenilins are transmembrane proteases required for the proteolytic cleavage of  Notch and also act as the catalytic core of the ?-secretase complex, which is responsible for the final cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein into Amyloid-ß (Aß) peptides of varying lengths. Presenilin-1 gene (psen1) mutations are the main cause of early-onset autosomal-dominant Familial Alzheimer Disease.  Elucidating the roles of Presenilin-1 and other hallmark proteins involved in Alzheimers disease is crucial for understanding the disease etiology and underlying molecular mechanisms. In our study, we used a morpholino antisense nucleotide that targets exon 8 splicing site of psen1 resulting in a dominant negative protein previously validated to investigate behavioral and molecular effects in 5 days post fertilization (dpf) zebrafish larvae. Morphants showed specific cognitive deficits in two optomotor tasks and morphological phenotypes similar to those induced by suppression of Notch signaling pathway. They also had increased mRNA levels of neurog1 at 5 dpf, confirming the potential interaction of Presenilin-1 and Notch in our model. We also evaluated levels of apoptotic markers including p53, PAR-4, Caspase-8 and bax-alpha and found [MASK] bax-a decreased at 5dpf. Western Blot analysis showed an increase in Aß1-42 and a decrease in the selective post-synaptic marker PSD-95 at 5 dpf.

      "[CLS] Alzheimer disease is associated with deposition of the amyloidogenic peptide Aß in the brain. Passive immunization using Aß-specific antibodies has been demonstrated to reduce amyloid deposition both in vitro and in vivo Because N-terminally truncated pyroglutamate (pE)-modified Aß species (AßpE3) exhibit enhanced aggregation potential and propensity to form toxic oligomers, they represent particularly attractive [MASK]s for antibody therapy. Here we present three separate monoclonal antibodies that specifically recognize AßpE3 with affinities of 1-10 nm and inhibit AßpE3 fibril formation in vitro. In vivo application of one of these resulted in improved memory in AßpE3 oligomer-treated mice. Crystal structures of Fab-AßpE3 complexes revealed two distinct binding modes for the peptide. Juxtaposition of pyroglutamate pE3 and the F4 side chain (the \"pEF head\") confers a pronounced bulky hydrophobic nature to the AßpE3 N terminus that might explain the enhanced aggregation properties of the modified peptide. The deep burial of the pEF head by two of the antibodies explains their  high [MASK] specificity and low cross-reactivity, making them promising candidates for the development of clinical antibodies.

There is little information on the cognitive profile of individuals with MCR syndrome and [MASK] overlap with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) syndrome.  This study aimed to examine and compare the cognitive performance of non-demented older community dwellers with and without MCR and MCI syndromes. METHODS: A total of 291 non-demented individuals were selected from the Gait and  Alzheimer Interactions Tracking study, which is a cross-sectional study. All participants were referred to a memory clinic. Individuals with and without MCR were separated into those with and without MCI. Cognitive performance was measured using the scores of the Mini Mental Status Examination, Frontal Assessment Battery, Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test, Trail Making Test part A and B, and Stroop test. RESULTS: The prevalence of MCI was 40.1% and that of MCR was 18.2%, with a higher prevalence of MCI in MCR group compared with the non-MCR group (47.2% vs. 39.5%). Individuals with MCR and MCI syndromes had poorer cognitive performance in all domains compared with those without MCR (P < 0.005), except for the ratio part III: part I of the Stroop test (P = 0.345). The association between cognitive performance and MCR syndrome was worse on the Mini Mental Status Examination score [effect size, -0.57 (95% confidence interval, -1.02 to -0.12)] and Trail Making Test part B [effect size, 0.59 (95% confidence interval, 0.14-1.04)] in individuals with MCR and MCI syndromes.

      "[CLS] Previous studies have demonstrated that the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1) plays conflicting roles in Alzheimers disease  (AD) pathogenesis, clearing ß-amyloid (Aß) from the brain while also enhancing APP endocytosis and resultant amyloidogenic processing. We have recently discovered that co-expression of mutant LRP1 C-terminal domain (LRP1-CT C4408R) with Swedish mutant amyloid precursor protein (APPswe) in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells decreases Aß production, while also increasing sAPPa and APP a-C-terminal fragment (a-CTF), compared with CHO cells [MASK] APPswe alone. Surprisingly, the location of this mutation on LRP1 corresponded with the a-secretase cleavage site of APP. Further experimentation confirmed that in CHO cells [MASK] APPswe or wild-type APP (APPwt), co-expression of LRP1-CT C4408R decreases Aß and increases sAPPa and a-CTF compared with co-expression of wild-type LRP1-CT. In addition, LRP1-CT C4408R enhanced the unglycosylated form of LRP1-CT and reduced APP endocytosis as determined by flow cytometry. This finding identifies a point mutation in LRP1 which slows LRP1-CT-mediated APP endocytosis and amyloidogenic processing, while enhancing APP a-secretase cleavage, thus demonstrating a potential novel target for slowing AD pathogenesis.

Several clinically important EOs and their components from Nigella sativa, Acorus gramineus, Lavandula angustifolia, Eucalyptus globulus, Mentha piperita, Rosmarinus officinalis, Jasminum sambac, Piper nigrum and so many other plants are reported for neuroprotective effects. This review article was aimed to summarize the current finding on EOs tested against neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer disease (AD) and [MASK] The effects of EOs on pathological targets of AD and dementia including amyloid deposition (Aß), neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), cholinergic hypofunction, oxidative stress and glutamatergic abnormalities were focused. Furthermore, effects of EOs on other neurological disorders including anxiety, depression, cognitive hypofunction epilepsy and convulsions were also evaluated in detail. In conclusion, EOs were effective on several pathological targets and have improved  cognitive performance in animal models and human subjects. Thus, EOs can be developed as multi-potent agents against neurological disorders with better efficacy, safety and cost effectiveness. [SEP]\t\tdementia.\n",

N-terminally truncated Aß(11-40) and Aß(11-42) make up one fifth of plaque load yet nothing is known about their interaction with full-length Aß(1-40/42) . We show that in contrast to C-terminally truncated isoforms, which do not co-fibrillize, deletions of ten residues from the N terminus of Aß have little impact on its ability to co-fibrillize with the full-length counterpart. As a consequence, N-terminally truncated Aß will accelerate fiber formation and co-assemble into short rod-shaped fibers with its  full-length Aß counterpart. This has implications for the assembly kinetics, morphology, and toxicity of all Aß isoforms. [SEP]\t\tdifferent\n",

We hypothesize that chronic glucocorticoids may down-regulate  the [MASK] of glucocorticoids receptor (GR) and activate NLRP-1 inflammasome  in hippocampal neurons, which may promote neuroinflammation and induce neuronal injury. The present results showed that chronic DEX exposure significantly increased LDH release and apoptosis, decreased MAP2 and GR [MASK] in hippocampal neurons. DEX (5µ?) exposure for 3d significantly increased the [MASK] of NLRP-1, ASC, caspase-1 and IL-1ß in the hippocampal neurons and the release of IL-1ß and IL-18 in the supernatants.

The GR antagonist, mifepristone (RU486), had protective effects on chronic DEX induced hippocampal neurons injury and NLRP1 inflammasome activation.

      "[CLS] Context and Objective: We investigated the associations of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), glycated albumin (GA), GA/HbA1c ratio, and 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG)  with the development of Alzheimers disease (AD). Design and Participants: A total of 1187 community-dwelling Japanese subjects aged =65 years without dementia were followed up for an average of 4.8 years. Results: The age- and sex-adjusted incidence of AD increased significantly with higher quartiles of GA/HbA1c ratio, and a similar tendency [MASK] seen for GA, whereas no such association [MASK] observed for HbA1c and 1,5-AG. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, positive association of GA/HbA1c ratio with the risk of AD remained significant: the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) [MASK] significantly higher in the third [HR = 2.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) =  1.16 to 3.82] and fourth (HR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.09 to 3.68) quartile than in the  first quartile. Among subjects with normal glucose tolerance, those with high GA/HbA1c ratio had a higher risk of AD than those with low GA/HbA1c ratio (HR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.05 to 3.16), and a similar tendency [MASK] found in those with glucose intolerance (HR = 1.73, 95% CI = 0.96 to 3.13). No such associations were observed for HbA1c, GA, and 1,5-AG, regardless of glucose tolerance status. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that elevated GA/HbA1c ratio-but not HbA1c, GA, or 1,5-AG level-is significantly associated with the risk of AD in subjects both  with and without glucose intolerance. GA/HbA1c ratio may be a useful biomarker for predicting incident AD. [SEP]\t\twas\n",

      "[CLS] Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia characterized by progressive cognitive decline. Current diagnosis of AD is based on symptoms, neuropsychological tests, and neuroimaging, and is usually evident years after the pathological process. Early assessment at the preclinical or prodromal stage  is in a great demand since treatment after the onset can hardly stop or reverse the disease progress. However, early diagnosis of AD is challenging due to the lack of reliable noninvasive approaches. Here, an antibody-mimetic self-assembling peptoid nanosheet containing [MASK] Aß42-recognizing loops is constructed, and a label-free sensor for the detection of AD serum is developed. The loop-displaying peptoid nanosheet is demonstrated to have high affinity to serum Aß42, and to be able to identify AD sera with high sensitivity. The dense distribution of molecular recognition loops on the robust peptoid nanosheet scaffold not only mimics the architecture of antibodies, but also reduces the nonspecific binding in detecting multicomponent samples. This antibody-mimetic 2D material holds great potential toward the blood-based diagnosis of AD, and meanwhile provides novel insights into the antibody alternative engineering and the universal application in biological and chemical  sensors.

      "[CLS] Alzheimers disease (AD) has been attributed to chronic bacterial infections. The recognition of human microbiota as a substantial contributor to health and disease is relatively recent and growing. During evolution, mammals live in a symbiotic state with myriads of microorganisms that survive at a diversity of tissue micro-surroundings. Microbes produce a plethora of secretory products [amyloids, lipopolysaccharides, virulence factors rhamnolipids (RLs), toxins, and a great number of neuroactive compounds]. The contribution of infectious microbial components to the pathophysiology of the human central nervous system including AD is considered potentially substantial, but the involvement of the RLs has never been reported. Here, RLs were isolated from serum and identified through various conventional methods including the colorimetric orcinol method, thin-layer chromatography, attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR), and dot blot using antibodies against RLs. Dot blot demonstrated elevated RL [MASK] in sera of AD patients compared to controls (p?=?0.014). Moreover, ELISA showed similarly elevated RL [MASK] in cerebrospinal fluid of both AD (0.188 versus 0.080) (p?=?0.04) and mild cognitive impairment (0.188 versus 0.129) (p?=?0.088) patients compared to healthy, and are well-correlated with the AD stages severity assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination. These results provide conclusive evidence for the newly-reported implication of RLs in AD, adding it to the list of bacterial components, opening new avenues for AD investigation.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: The few studies that have focused on Time between Onset of Signs and  Symptoms and Referral (TOSR) for dementia to a memory center suggest a substantial delay of 1-3 years. This delay has a negative impact on both patients and their caregivers quality of life. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate this delay and the factors associated with it in a cohort of community-dwelling elderly people attending a memory clinic, as well as assess the impact of the Third French National Alzheimer Plan  (2008-2012). METHODS: All patients referred to the Bretonneau Memory [MASK] for the first time between January 2006 (the clinic has maintained a specific database since then) and March 2016 were included in the study. RESULTS: Of the 8543 patients attending our Memory [MASK] during the study period, 3353 attending for the first time and with complete data were included. Briefly, their ages were 82±7 years, and 67.2% were female; MMSE score was 21.2±6.6, IADL was 4.06±0.78 and the social-needs category of the Groupes Iso Ressources (GIR); Iso-Resource Group (IRG) scale was 4.04±0.37. The TOSR was, on  average, 35.4±30.24 months, and increased after implementation of the Third French National Alzheimer Plan, from 26.68±26.28 months before 2009 to 40.08±31.2 months after 2009. Age and MMSE were associated with TOSR, but not the type of dementia, household composition and social characteristics. Also, there was a shorter TOSR for mild cognitive impairment than for dementia patients.

Based on a previous clinical trial, body weight of less than 55 kg is a risk factor for adverse events with donepezil 23 mg/d treatment in global population. METHODS/PROCEDURES: To clarify whether this finding is consistent across ethnic groups that vary in absolute body mass, we recruited Korean patients aged 45 to 90 years with moderate to severe AD who had been receiving standard donepezil immediate release 10 mg/d for at least 3 months. After screening, we analyzed a final cohort of 166 patients who received donepezil 23 mg/d for 24 weeks to compare the occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) between patients with high versus low body mass index (BMI) based on the World Health Organization overweight criteria for Asian populations (23 kg/m). FINDINGS/RESULTS: Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported by 79.45% of patients in the [MASK] BMI group and 58.06% of patients in the higher BMI group (odds ratio, 2.79; 95% confidence interval, 1.39-5.63; ? = 7.58, P = 0.006).

For example, the overall impact on seizure control has not been substantial with approximately 30% of patients remaining refractory or their seizures not adequately controlled. Also there is need for epilepsy prevention and for certain sub-populations with severe intractable epilepsy. High unmet need often drives new industry investment into therapeutic market opportunities, however the profound success of antiepileptic drugs has contributed to the hurdles for industry investment in new therapies for epilepsy. Furthermore, the payor environment has also changed with new challenges for evidence generation and demonstration of additive value above existing standard of care treatments.

In vivo approaches were carried out [MASK] various transgenic and knockout animals as well as in adeno-associated virus-infected mice.

RESULTS: We show that presenilins 1 and 2 trigger opposite effects [MASK] promoter transactivati[MASK], messenger RNA, and protein expressi[MASK] of Pink-1. This c[MASK]trol is linked to ?-secretase activity and ß-amyloid precursor protein but is independent of phosphatase and tensin homolog.

Interestingly, the modulati[MASK] of ?-secretase activity or AICD expressi[MASK] affects Pink-1-related c[MASK]trol of mitophagy and mitoch[MASK]drial dynamics.

The studies also show that being old and having alcohol use disorders are two unfavourable conditions for receiving help, whereas for the Alzheimers disease, there is a clear need for optimal care. In this article, we study professional home caregivers perceptions of their job along with their difficulties and satisfactions in supporting older people with Alzheimers disease or alcohol misuse. Out of the 23 professionals approached, 17 took part in a research interview from October 2013 to January 2014. All interviews were recorded, fully  transcribed and lexically analysed with Alceste® software. Among the five classes that were identified from 63% of the initial data, the main themes that emerged illustrate the nature of the associated pathologies, the perceptions and satisfactions related to the profession, their adaptive skills, the difficulties  related to the life context of the older person, and the wine consumption of the  latter. The lexical discourse analysis shows that the professional home caregivers are involved in looking after not only people with Alzheimers disease but also those with alcohol misuse. However, despite the difficulties and satisfactions encountered, adaptation to the older people seems to be their priority and one of the many skills that they have acquired during their professionalisation. Most of the older people who are helped are women and the difficulties mentioned by their caregivers usually arise at the time of their death.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: With the expected increase in the numbers of pers[MASK]s with dementia, providing timely, adequate, and affordable care and support is challenging. Assistive and health technologies may be a valuable c[MASK]tributi[MASK] in dementia care, but new challenges may emerge. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to review the state of the art of technologies for pers[MASK]s with dementia regarding issues [MASK] development, usability, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, deployment, and ethics in 3 fields of applicati[MASK] of technologies: (1) support with managing everyday life, (2) support with participating in pleasurable and meaningful activities, and (3)  support with dementia health and social care provisi[MASK]. The study also aimed to identify gaps in the evidence and challenges for future research. METHODS: Reviews of literature and expert opini[MASK]s were used in our study. Literature searches were c[MASK]ducted [MASK] usability, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, and ethics using PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and PsycINFO databases with no time limit. Selecti[MASK] criteria in our selected technology fields were reviews in English for community-dwelling pers[MASK]s with dementia. Regarding deployment issues, searches were d[MASK]e in Health Technology Assessment databases. RESULTS: According to our results, pers[MASK]s with dementia want to be included in the development of technologies; there is little research [MASK] the usability of assistive technologies; various benefits are reported but are mainly based [MASK] low-quality studies; barriers to deployment of technologies in dementia care were identified, and ethical issues were raised by researchers but often not studied.

CONCLUSIONS: Based [MASK] these findings, various acti[MASK]s are recommended for development, usability, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, deployment, and ethics of assistive and health technologies across Europe. These include avoiding replicati[MASK] of technology development that is unhelpful or ineffective and focusing [MASK] how technologies succeed in addressing individual needs of pers[MASK]s with dementia. Furthermore, it is suggested to include these recommendati[MASK]s in nati[MASK]al and internati[MASK]al calls for funding and assistive technology research programs. Finally, practiti[MASK]ers, policy makers, care insurers, and care providers should work together with technology enterprises and researchers to prepare strategies for the implementati[MASK] of assistive technologies in different  care settings.

      "[CLS] Echinacoside is a phenylethanoid glycoside and possesses neuroprotective activity in vitro and in vivo. This study investigates the role of the amyloid cascade and central neuronal function on the protective effects of echinacoside in amyloid ß  peptide 1-42 (Aß 1-42)-treated SH-SY5Y cells and an Aß 1-42-infused rat. Echinacoside inhibited Aß 1-42 oligomerization in vitro and restored the cell viability that was reduced by Aß 1-42 in SH-SY5Y cells. Intracisternal infusion with Aß 1-42 by an osmotic pump caused cognitive deficits, an increase in amyloid deposition and acetylcholinesterase activities, and a decrease in the brains levels of acetylcholine and dopamine. Echinacoside reduced the cognitive deficits and amyloid deposition, and it reversed the cortical cholinergic dysfunction that was caused by Aß 1-42 in rats. Echinacoside further reversed the memory impairment in the Morris water [MASK] task caused by scopolamine in mice. Therefore, we suggest that echinacoside ameliorated cognitive dysfunction that was caused by Aß 1-42 by blocking amyloid deposition via inhibiting amyloid oligomerization and reversing the cortical cholinergic neuronal function via decreasing amyloid neurotoxicity.

      "[CLS] Amyloid-ß (Aß) peptides have taken a central role in AD research, the aggregation of Aß peptide is involved in the progression of Alzheimers disease (AD). The 35th amino acid was methionine (Met) in Aß peptides and its redox state is critical in determining the biological activity of Aß. It has been suggested that oxidation of Met35 (Met35O) plays a key role in the formation of paranuclei and in the control of oligomerization pathway choice.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: With increasing numbers of people surviving beyond eighty years, this section of the population demands attention to reduce the impact of dementia. In  order to develop effective preventative strategies, it is essential to understand age-specific risk factor profiles for dementia: do risk factors for dementia in those in their sixties and seventies persist into oldest age? The aims of this study were to determine incident dementia and to investigate the risk profile for dementia from age 79 to 95 years in a well-characterised [MASK]. METHODS: Participants underwent intelligence testing at age 11 and were followed-up from at 79 years of age. Variables included: age, sex, age 11 IQ, APOE ?4, education, diabetes, hypertension, statin use, physical activity at leisure and in occupation, symptoms of depression, height, number of teeth, body  mass index, blood pressure, cholesterol and HbA1c. Dementia cases were ascertained from death certificates, electronic patient records and clinical reviews. Logistic regression analysis determined the degree of risk for dementia  associated with each variable. Analyses were completed both with and without the  physical activity variables due to the significant number of missing data for these variables. RESULTS: Of the eligible [MASK], n = 410 participants remained dementia-free and  n = 110 had developed probable dementia. When logistic regression analyses contained all variables, complete data was available for n = 234 (n = 48 with dementia). Results demonstrated that positive APOE ?4 carrier status (OR: 2.15, 95% CI: 1.04, 4.42) and greater lifetime physical activity (OR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.28) increased the risk for dementia. A reduction in risk for dementia was seen for hypertension (OR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.23, 0.98). When physical activity variables were excluded, the number with complete data increased to n = 377 (n = 80 with dementia). APOE ?4 remained significant (OR: 2.37; 95% CI: 1.37, 4.07), as did hypertension (OR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.32, 0.93). CONCLUSIONS: Dementia incidence was consistent with expected rates. The risk profile for dementia in this [MASK] of participants aged 79-95 confirmed previous findings that risk factors differ for those over 79 years. Further evidence is recommended in order that the risk profile for this age group can be accurately determined. [SEP]\t\tcohort\n",

      "[CLS] Motivation: Network-based genome-wide association studies (GWAS) aim to identify  functional modules from biological networks that are enriched by top GWAS findings. Although gene functions are relevant to tissue context, most existing methods analyze tissue-free networks without reflecting phenotypic specificity. Results: We propose a novel module [MASK] framework for imaging genetic studies using the tissue-specific functional interaction network. Our method includes three steps: (i) re-prioritize imaging GWAS findings by applying machine learning methods to incorporate network topological information and enhance the connectivity among top genes; (ii) detect densely connected modules based on interactions among top re-prioritized genes; and (iii) identify phenotype-relevant modules enriched by top GWAS findings. We demonstrate our method on the GWAS of [18F]FDG-PET measures in the amygdala region using the imaging genetic data from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, and map the GWAS results onto the amygdala-specific functional interaction network. The proposed network-based GWAS method can effectively detect densely connected modules enriched by top GWAS findings. Tissue-specific functional network can provide precise context to help explore the collective effects of genes with biologically meaningful interactions specific to the studied phenotype.

      "[CLS] Gait disorders are major causes of falls in patients with neurological diseases.  Understanding these disorders allows prevention and better insights into underlying diseases. InertiaLocoGraphy (ILG) -the quantification of gait by using [MASK] measurement units (IMUs) -shows great potential to address this public health challenge, but protocols vary widely and normative values of gait parameters are still unavailable. This systematic review critically compares ILG  protocols, questions features extracted from [MASK] signals and proposes a semeiological analysis of clinimetric characteristics for use in neurological clinical routine. For this systematic review, PubMed, Cochrane and EMBASE were searched for articles assessing gait quality by using IMUs that were published from January 1, 2014 to August 31, 2016. ILG was used to assess gait in a wide range of neurological disorders - including Parkinson disease, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer disease, cerebral palsy, and cerebellar atrophy - as well as in the faller or frail older population and in people presenting rheumatological pathologies. However, results have not yet been driving changes in clinical practice. One reason could be that studies mainly aimed at comparing  pathological gait to healthy gait, but there is stronger need for semiological descriptions of gait perturbation, severity or prognostic assessment. Furthermore, protocols used to assess gait using IMUs are too many. Likely, outcomes are highly heterogeneous and difficult to compare across large panels of studies. Therefore, homogenization is needed to foster the use of ILG to assess gait quality in neurological routine practice. The pros and cons of each protocol are emphasized so that a compromise can be reached. As well, analysis of seven complementary clinical criteria (springiness, sturdiness, smoothness, steadiness, stability, symmetry, synchronization) is advocated. [SEP]\t\tinertial\n",

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: [MASK] spin-labeling MR imaging has been recently developed as a noninvasive technique with magnetically labeled arterial blood water as an endogenous contrast medium for the evaluation of CBF. Our aim was to  compare arterial spin-labeling MR imaging and SPECT in the visual assessment of CBF in patients with Alzheimer disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 33 patients with Alzheimer disease or mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer disease, CBF images were obtained by using both arterial spin-labeling-MR imaging with a postlabeling delay of 1.5 seconds and 2.5 seconds (PLD1.5 and PLD2.5, respectively) and brain perfusion SPECT. Twenty-two brain regions were visually assessed, and the diagnostic confidence of Alzheimer disease was recorded. RESULTS: Among all arterial spin-labeling images, 84.9% of PLD1.5 and 9% of PLD2.5 images showed the typical pattern of advanced Alzheimer disease (ie, decreased CBF in the bilateral parietal, temporal, and frontal lobes). PLD1.5, PLD2.5, and SPECT imaging resulted in obviously different visual assessments. PLD1.5 showed a broad decrease in CBF, which could have been due to an early perfusion. In contrast, PLD2.5 did not appear to be influenced by an early perfusion but showed fewer pathologic findings than SPECT. CONCLUSIONS: The distinctions observed by us should be carefully considered in the visual assessments of Alzheimer disease. Further studies are required to define the patterns of change in arterial spin-labeling-MR imaging associated with Alzheimer disease. [SEP]\t\tArterial\n",

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: A lot of attention has been paid to the relationship of blood pressure and dementia because epidemiological research has reported conflicting evidence. Observational data has shown that midlife hypertension is a risk factor for cognitive decline and dementia later in life, whereas there is evidence that  low blood pressure is predictive in later life. The aim of the present [MASK] was  to examine the association between dementia and blood pressure measured up to 27 years (mean 17.6 years) prior to ascertainment. METHODS: In Nord-Trøndelag County, Norway, incident dementia data were collected  during 1995-2011, and the diagnoses were validated by a panel of experts in the field. By using the subjects personal identification numbers, the dementia data  were linked to data from the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study (the HUNT Study), a large, population-based health [MASK] performed in 1984-1986 (HUNT 1) and 1995-1997 (HUNT 2). A total of 24,638 participants of the HUNT Study were included in the present [MASK], 579 of whom were diagnosed with Alzheimer disease, mixed Alzheimer/vascular dementia, or vascular dementia. Multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to analyze the association between dementia and blood pressure data from HUNT 1 and HUNT 2. RESULTS: Over the age of 60 years, consistent inverse associations were observed  between systolic blood pressure and all-cause dementia, mixed Alzheimer/vascular  dementia, and Alzheimer disease, but not with vascular dementia, when adjusting for age, sex, education, and other relevant covariates. This was observed for systolic blood pressure in both HUNT 1 and HUNT 2, regardless of antihypertensive medication use. There was an adverse association between systolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, and Alzheimer disease in individuals treated with antihypertensive medication under the age of 60 years. CONCLUSIONS: Our data are in line with those in previous studies demonstrating an inverse association between dementia and systolic blood pressure in individuals over the age of 60 years. We cannot exclude a survival effect, however. Among middle-aged subjects (<60 years), elevated systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure were associated with eventual Alzheimer disease in individuals who reported using antihypertensive medication.

      "[CLS] Alzheimers disease is associated with the aggregation of amyloid-ß (Aß) peptides into oligomers and fibrils. We have explored how model lipid membranes modulate the rate and mechanisms of Aß(1-42) self-assembly, in order to shed light on how  this pathological reaction may occur in the lipid-rich environments that the peptide encounters in the brain. Using a combination of in vitro biophysical experiments and theoretical approaches, we show that zwitterionic DOPC lipid [MASK] accelerate the Aß(1-42) fibril growth rate by interacting specifically with the growing fibrils. We probe this interaction with help of a purpose-developed Förster resonance energy transfer assay that monitors the proximity between a fibril-specific dye and fluorescent lipids in the lipid vesicle membrane. To further rationalise these findings we use mathematical models to fit the aggregation kinetics of Aß(1-42) and find that lipid [MASK] alter specific mechanistic steps in the aggregation reaction; they augment monomer-dependent secondary nucleation at the surface of existing fibrils and facilitate monomer-independent catalytic processes consistent with fibril fragmentation. We further show that DOPC [MASK] have no effect on primary nucleation. This finding is consistent with experiments showing that Aß(1-42) monomers do not directly bind to the lipid bilayer. Taken together, our results show that plain lipid membranes with charge and composition that is representative of outer cell membranes can significantly augment autocatalytic steps in the self-assembly of Aß(1-42) into fibrils. This new insight suggests that strategies to reduce fibril-lipid interactions in the brain may have therapeutic value. [SEP]\t\tvesicles\n",

      "[CLS] Calibrated fMRI based on arterial spin-labeling (ASL) and blood oxygen-dependent  contrast (BOLD), [MASK] with periods of hypercapnia and hyperoxia, can provide  information on cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), resting blood flow (CBF), oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), and resting oxidative metabolism (CMRO2). Vascular and metabolic integrity are believed to be affected in Alzheimers disease (AD), thus, the use of calibrated fMRI in AD may help understand the disease and monitor therapeutic responses in future clinical trials. In the present work, we  applied a calibrated fMRI approach referred to as Quantitative O2 (QUO2) in a cohort of probable AD dementia and age-matched control participants. The resulting CBF, OEF and CMRO2 values fell within the range from previous studies using positron emission tomography (PET) with 15O labeling. Moreover, the typical parietotemporal pattern of hypoperfusion and hypometabolism in AD was observed, especially in the precuneus, a particularly vulnerable region. We detected no deficit in frontal CBF, nor in whole grey matter CVR, which supports the hypothesis that the effects observed were associated specifically with AD rather  than generalized vascular disease. Some key pitfalls affecting both ASL and BOLD  methods were encountered, such as prolonged arterial transit times (particularly  in the occipital lobe), the presence of susceptibility artifacts obscuring medial temporal regions, and the challenges associated with the hypercapnic manipulation in AD patients and elderly participants. The present results are encouraging and  demonstrate the promise of calibrated fMRI measurements as potential biomarkers in AD. Although CMRO2 can be imaged with 15O PET, the QUO2 method uses more widely available imaging infrastructure, avoids exposure to ionizing radiation, and integrates with other MRI-based measures of brain structure and function.

A mechanism is proposed that is based on the full-length monomeric structure of the protein, on hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry data, and on the role of [MASK] disordered regions to control protein motions. It is proposed that lipid binds between the N-terminal and C-terminal domains and that separation of the two domains, along with the presence of [MASK] disordered regions, controls this process.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of total tau (t-tau) and Aß1-42  are [MASK] early diagnostic markers for probable Alzheimers disease (AD). The influence of genetic variation on these CSF biomarkers has been investigated in candidate or genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, the investigation of statistically modest associations in GWAS in the context of biological networks is still an under-explored topic in AD studies. The main objective of this study is to gain further biological insights via the integration of statistical gene associations in AD with physical protein interaction networks. RESULTS: The CSF and genotyping data of 843 study subjects (199 CN, 85 SMC, 239 EMCI, 207 LMCI, 113 AD) from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were analyzed. PLINK was used to perform GWAS on the t-tau/Aß1-42 ratio using quality controlled genotype data, including 563,980 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), with age, sex and diagnosis as covariates. Gene-level p-values were obtained by VEGAS2. Genes with p-value?=?0.05 were mapped on to a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network (9,617 nodes, 39,240 edges, from the HPRD Database). We integrated a consensus model strategy into the iPINBPA network analysis framework, and named it as CM-iPINBPA. Four consensus modules (CMs) were discovered by CM-iPINBPA, and were functionally annotated using the pathway analysis tool Enrichr. The intersection of four CMs forms a common subnetwork of  29 genes, including those related to tau phosphorylation (GSK3B, SUMO1, AKAP5, CALM1 and DLG4), amyloid beta production (CASP8, PIK3R1, PPA1, PARP1, CSNK2A1, NGFR, and RHOA), and AD (BCL3, CFLAR, SMAD1, and HIF1A). CONCLUSIONS: This study coupled a consensus module (CM) strategy with the iPINBPA network analysis framework, and applied it to the GWAS of CSF t-tau/Aß1-42 ratio  in an AD study. The genome-wide network analysis yielded 4 enriched CMs that share not only genes related to tau phosphorylation or amyloid beta production but also multiple genes enriching several KEGG pathways such as Alzheimers disease, colorectal cancer, gliomas, renal cell carcinoma, Huntingtons disease,  and others. This study demonstrated that integration of gene-level associations with CMs could yield statistically significant findings to offer valuable biological insights (e.g., functional interaction among the protein products of these genes) and suggest high confidence candidates for subsequent analyses.

Such passive external memory aids have started to be considered as alternatives to both more active external aids (such  as writing in diaries, journals, and timetables) and to internal cognitive strategies (such as spaced retrieval, errorless learning). OBJECTIVE: In order to understand the benefits of these innovative devices for memory compensation, the present experiment examined the effectiveness of two memory training strategies: SenseCam, a wearable camera, a passive external memory aid and a memory training programme (MEMO+) created from tasks known to stimulate memory, in comparison with a control condition, a personal written diary. METHOD: Fifty-one patients with mild AD were randomly assigned to one of these three groups. Training lasted for six consecutive weeks, two sessions a week, one hour each, for all groups. Patients underwent a neuropsychological assessment at  baseline, after treatment and at follow up (six months later). RESULTS: Groups showed non-significant differences at baseline. After treatment and at follow up, the SenseCam group had a superior autobiographical memory (AM)  performance, compared to the Memo+ and Diary groups. The SenseCam and the Memo+ groups both showed improved episodic and semantic memory, and somewhat improved executive function.

Methods: Database searches were conducted across CIN[MASK]HL Complete, OTseeker, PubMed, Ovid, [MASK]cademic One File, ProQuest Nursing and [MASK]llied Health, the World Wide Web and Google Scholar using the several key words that included neurocognitive disorders, [MASK]lzheimers, dementia, quality of life, well-being, occupational performance, activities of daily living, small scale shared housing, sheltered housing and group homes. Bibliographic references from final articles were also examined. Selection criteria involved three steps: screening perspective articles by title and abstract, assessing full text for eligibility and finally, reviewing full-texts. Results: 16 studies were selected for final review where most found the association of SH[MASK]s with various occupational performance indicators unique to the NCD population better than or equal to controls (traditional models of long term care). [MASK] small minority of studies had mixed or inconclusive results. No study found SH[MASK]s necessarily worse than controls. Conclusion: The SH[MASK] model has many benefits for persons with NCD and may be especially advantageous for those in the early stages of the disease process. The occupational therapy profession should continue to raise awareness of SH[MASK]s and consider ecological theory as a valid basis for their expansion. [SEP]\t\tA\n",

      "[CLS] Conformational change and modification of proteins are involved in many cellular  functions. However, they can also have adverse effects that are implicated in numerous diseases. How structural change promotes disease is generally not well[MASK]understood. This perspective illustrates how mass spectrometry (MS), followed by toxicological and epidemiological validation, can discover disease[MASK]relevant structural changes and therapeutic strategies. We (with our collaborators) set out to characterize the structural and toxic consequences of disease[MASK]associated mutations and post[MASK]translational modifications (PTMs) of the cytosolic antioxidant protein Cu/Zn[MASK]superoxide dismutase (SOD1). Previous genetic studies discovered >180 different mutations in the SOD1 gene that caused familial (inherited) amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (fALS). Using hydrogen[MASK]deuterium exchange with mass spectrometry, we determined that diverse disease[MASK]associated SOD1 mutations cause a common structural defect [MASK] perturbation of the SOD1 electrostatic loop. X[MASK]ray crystallographic studies had demonstrated that this leads to protein aggregation through a specific interaction between the electrostatic loop and an exposed beta[MASK]barrel edge strand. Using epidemiology methods, we then determined that decreased SOD1 stability and increased protein aggregation are powerful risk factors for fALS progression, with a combined hazard ratio > 300 (for comparison, a lifetime of smoking is associated with a hazard ratio of ~15 for lung cancer). The resulting structural model of fALS etiology supported the hypothesis that some sporadic ALS (sALS, ~80% of ALS is not associated with a gene defect) could be caused by post[MASK]translational protein  modification of wild[MASK]type SOD1. We developed immunocapture antibodies and high sensitivity top[MASK]down MS methods and characterized PTMs of wild[MASK]type SOD1 using human tissue samples. Using global hydrogen[MASK]deuterium exchange, X[MASK]ray crystallography and neurotoxicology, we then characterized toxic and protective subsets of SOD1 PTMs. To cap this perspective, we present proof[MASK]of[MASK]concept that post[MASK]translational modification can cause disease. We show that numerous mutations (N?D; Q?E), which result in the same chemical structure as the PTM deamidation, cause multiple diseases. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. [SEP]\t\t-\n",

      "[CLS] Cerebral small-vessel damage manifests as white matter hyperintensities and cerebral atrophy on brain MRI and is associated with aging, cognitive decline and dementia. We sought to examine the interrelationship of these imaging biomarkers  and the influence of hypertension in older individuals. We used a multivariate spatial covariance neuroimaging technique to localize the effects of white matter lesion load on regional gray matter volume and assessed the role of blood pressure control, age and education on this relationship. Using a case-control design matching for age, gender, and educational attainment we selected 64 participants with normal blood pressure, controlled hypertension or uncontrolled  hypertension from the Northern Manhattan Study cohort. We applied gray matter voxel-based morphometry with the scaled subprofile model to (1) identify regional covariance patterns of gray matter volume differences associated with white matter lesion load, (2) compare this relationship across blood pressure groups, and (3) relate it to cognitive performance. In this group of participants aged 60-86 years, we identified a pattern of reduced gray matter volume associated with white matter lesion load in bilateral temporal-parietal regions with relative preservation of volume in the basal forebrain, thalami and cingulate cortex. This pattern was expressed most in the uncontrolled hypertension group and least in the normotensives, but was also more evident in older and more educated individuals. Expression of this pattern was associated with worse performance in executive [MASK] and memory. In summary, white matter lesions from small-vessel disease are associated with a regional pattern of gray matter atrophy that is mitigated by blood pressure control, exacerbated by aging, and associated with cognitive performance.

      "[CLS] About 30-70% of familial Alzheimers disease (AD) cases are related to mutations  in presenilin-1 gene (PSEN1). Although the role of mutations and common variants  in AD had been extensively investigated, the contribution of rare or low frequency PSEN1 variants on AD risk remains unclear. In the current study, we performed a mutational screening of PSEN1 coding exons and flanking intronic sequences among 53 index cases with familial history of AD from Rio de Janeiro (Brazil). Two missense variants (rs63750592; rs17125721), one rare and a low frequency variant, and two intronic variants (rs3025786; rs165932) were identified. In silico tools were used to predict the functional impact of the variants, revealing no changes in protein functionality by exonic variants. Otherwise, all variants were predicted to alter splicing signals. Prediction results, together with previous reports, suggest a correlation between rs17125721 and AD. [MASK] a subsequent case-control study to evaluate the role of rs1712572 on  AD risk was performed in an additional sample of 120 AD sporadic cases and in 149 elderly healthy controls by TaqMan Genotyping Assay.

In addition, we tested the multiplicative interaction between allele e4 of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) and rs17125721 and no statistical association was  found.

In this study, we investigated the characteristics of imperatorin transport in the brain. Experiments of the present study were designed to study imperatorin transport across the blood-brain barrier both in vivo and in vitro. In vivo study was performed in rats using single intravenous injection and in situ carotid artery perfusion technique. Conditionally immortalized rat brain capillary endothelial cells were as an in vitro model of blood-brain barrier to examine the transport mechanism of imperatorin. Brain distribution volume of imperatorin was about 6 fold greater than that of sucrose, suggesting that the transport of imperatorin was through the blood-brain barrier in physiological state. Both in vivo and in vitro imperatorin transport studies demonstrated that imperatorin could [MASK] transported  in a concentration-dependent manner with high affinity. Imperatorin uptake was dependent on proton gradient in an opposite direction. It was significantly reduced by pretreatment with sodium azide. However, its uptake was not inhibited  by replacing extracellular sodium with potassium or N-methylglucamine. The uptake of imperatorin was inhibited by various cationic compounds, but not inhibited by  TEA, choline and organic anion substances. Transfection of plasma membrane monoamine transporter, organic cation transporter 2 and organic cation/carnitine  transporter 2/1 siRNA failed to alter imperatorin transport in brain capillary endothelial cells. Especially, tramadol, clonidine and pyrilamine inhibited the uptake of [3H]imperatorin competitively. Therefore, imperatorin is actively transported from blood to brain across the blood-brain barrier by passive and carrier-mediated transporter. [SEP]\t\tbe\n",

      "[CLS] Down syndrome (DS) is the most common chromosomal aberration and genetically determined cause of intellectual disability. DS patients often present with some  congenital defects and chronic diseases, including early onset dementia, which affects 70% of DS patients over 55 years of age and has a clinical presentation similar to Alzheimer disease (AD). The symptoms of DS originate from excessive genetic material within the \"critical region\" of the 21st chromosome. The \"critical region\" encompasses genes potentially associated with increase risk of  dementia, e.g. the APP gene (amyloid beta precursor protein) which leads to excessive amyloid beta production. Post-mortem studies of DS patients brains revealed diffuse deposition of the insoluble form of amyloid beta (Aß), which is  a characteristic [MASK] of AD. Moreover, those changes were commonly observed in subjects > 31 years old. The pathomechanisms of AD have not been fully elucidated and scientists are still searching for new risk factors that may contribute to the development of this common illness. Recent research proved that lipid disturbance, especially disorders in the metabolism of HDL (high density lipoprotein) may play a crucial role in this pathogenic process.

Recently, ?-secretase-associating proteins showed promising role in specifically modulating APP processing while sparing Notch signaling; however, the [MASK] mechanism is still unclear. A co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) coupled with mass spectrometry proteomic assay for Presenilin1 (PS1, the catalytic subunit of ?-secretase) was firstly conducted to  find more ?-secretase-associating proteins. Gene ontology analysis of these results identified Rab21 as a potential PS1 interacting protein, and the interaction between them was validated by reciprocal Co-IP and immunofluorescence assay. Then, molecular and biochemical methods were used to investigate the effect of Rab21 on APP processing. Results showed that overexpression of Rab21 enhanced Aß generation, while silencing of Rab21 reduced the accumulation of Aß,  which resulted due to change in ?-secretase activity rather than a- or ß-secretase. Finally, we demonstrated that Rab21 had no effect on ?-secretase complex synthesis or metabolism but enhanced PS1 endocytosis and translocation to late endosome/lysosome. In conclusion, we identified a novel ?-secretase-associating protein Rab21 and illustrate that Rab21 promotes ?-secretase internalization and translocation to late endosome/lysosome. Moreover, silencing of Rab21 decreases the ?-secretase activity in APP processing thus production of Aß. All these results open new gateways towards the understanding of ?-secretase-associating proteins in APP processing and make inhibition of Rab21 a promising strategy for AD therapy.

METHOD: Chalcones were synthesized through a Claisen-Schmidt condensation and their inhibitory effect on the AChE was evaluated by the Elmanns colorimetric method. To determine the anti-oxidant activity the DPPH radical scavenging method was chosen. RESULTS: We found that all chalcones inhibit this activity, with IC50 values ranging from 0.008 to 4.8 µM. We selected the most active compound 19 with an IC50 value of 0.008 µM for a kinetic study demonstrating a competitive inhibition mode. Molecular docking simulations showed a good interaction between 19 and the  active site of AChE. Considering the prediction of pharmacokinetic parameters being a useful tool for selecting potential drug candidates, our study results suggest that the majority of chalcones, including the most active one, have a promising pharmacokinetic profile and blood-brain barrier permeability. The involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in AD-related events has encouraged  us to evaluate these chalcones as radical scavengers.

Our objective was to examine whether abnormalities in neuroimaging measures of amyloid and neurodegeneration are correlated with odor identification (OI) in the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging. METHODS: Cognitively normal (CN) participants had olfactory function assessed using the Brief Smell Identification Test (B-SIT), underwent magnetic resonance imaging (n = 829) to assess a composite AD signature cortical thickness and hippocampal volume (HVa), and underwent 11 C-Pittsburgh compound B (n = 306) and  18 fluorodeoxyglucose (n = 305) positron emission tomography scanning to assess amyloid accumulation and brain hypometabolism, respectively. The association of neuroimaging biomarkers with OI was examined using multinomial logistic regression and simple linear regression models adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: Among 829 CN participants (mean age = 79.2 years; 51.5% men), 248 (29.9%) were normosmic and 78 (9.4%) had anosmia (B-SIT score < 6). Abnormal AD signature cortical thickness and reduced HVa were associated with decreased OI as a continuous measure (slope = -0.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.76 to -0.09, p = 0.01 and slope = -0.72, 95% CI = -1.15 to -0.28, p < 0.01, respectively).

METHODS: Neuropsychiatric symptoms and the degree of cognitive impairment were assessed in a case-c[MASK]trol study of 91 neurosyphilis, 162 AD, 157 mild cognitive  impairment, and 139 normal c[MASK]trols by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) scale and Clinical Dementia Rating scale, respectively. Factor analysis was performed [MASK] the 12 NPI items. RESULTS: Factor analysis showed that patients with neurosyphilis showed more severe neuropsychiatric syndromes at the dementia stage than those neurosyphilis  patients at the mild cognitive impairment stage, while neuropsychiatric manifestati[MASK]s were equally comm[MASK] am[MASK]g the different stages of dementia (all p  < 0.05). Fr[MASK]tal lobe syndrome was more severe in patients with neurosyphilis than in patients with AD from the early mild cognitive impairment stage to the moderate dementia stage (all p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with neurosyphilis show different patterns of neuropsychiatric syndromes at the mild cognitive impairment and dementia stages,  and differ from patients with AD. [SEP]\t\ton\n",

      "[CLS] Aim: To assess the associations of age and diagnosis with visual ratings of medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA), parietal atrophy (PA), global cortical atrophy (GCA), and white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and to investigate their clinical value in a large memory clinic cohort. Methods: We included 2,934 patients (age 67 ± 9 years; 1,391 [MASK] female; MMSE 24 ± 5) from the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort (1,347 dementia due to Alzheimers disease [AD]; 681 mild cognitive impairment [MCI]; 906 controls with subjective cognitive decline). We analyzed the effect of age, APOE e4 and diagnosis on visual ratings using linear  regression analyses. Subsequently, we compared diagnostic and predictive value in three age-groups (<65 years, 65-75 years, and >75 years). Results: Linear regression analyses showed main effects of age and diagnosis and an interaction age*diagnosis for MTA, PA, and GCA. For MTA the interaction effect indicated steeper age effects in MCI and AD than in controls. PA and GCA increased with age in MCI and controls, while AD patients have a high score, regardless of age. For  WMH we found a main effect of age, but not of diagnosis. For MTA, GCA and PA, diagnostic value was best in patients <65 years (optimal cut-off: =1). PA and GCA only discriminated in patients <65 years and MTA in patients <75 years. WMH did not discriminate at all. Taking into account APOE did not affect the identified optimal cut-offs. When we used these scales to predict progression in MCI using Cox proportional hazard models, only MTA (cut-off =2) had any predictive value, restricted to patients >75 years. Conclusion: Visual ratings of atrophy and WMH were differently affected by age and diagnosis, requiring an age-specific approach in clinical practice. Their diagnostic value seems strongest in younger  patients. [SEP]\t\t[47%]\n",

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is a heterogeneous entity with multiple aetiologies, all linked to underlying vascular disease. Among these, VCI related to subcortical small vessel disease (SSVD) is emerging as a major homogeneous subtype. Its progressive course raises the need for biomarker identification and/or development for adequate therapeutic interventions to be tested. In order to shed light in the current status on biochemical markers for VCI-SSVD, experts in field reviewed the recent evidence and literature data. METHOD: The group conducted a comprehensive search on Medline, PubMed and Embase  databases for studies published until 15.01.2017. The proposal on current status  of biochemical markers in VCI-SSVD was reviewed by all co-authors and the draft was repeatedly circulated and discussed before it was finalized. RESULTS: This review identifies a large number of biochemical markers derived from CSF and blood. There is a considerable overlap of VCI-SSVD clinical symptoms with those of Alzheimers disease (AD). Although most of the published studies are small and their findings remain to be replicated in larger cohorts, several biomarkers have shown promise in separating VCI-SSVD from AD. These promising biomarkers are closely linked to underlying SSVD pathophysiology, namely disruption of blood-CSF and blood-brain barriers (BCB-BBB) and breakdown of white matter myelinated fibres and extracellular matrix, as well as blood and brain inflammation. The leading biomarker candidates are: [MASK] CSF/blood albumin ratio, which reflects BCB/BBB disruption; altered CSF matrix metalloproteinases,  reflecting extracellular matrix breakdown; CSF neurofilment as a marker of axonal damage, and possibly blood inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules. The suggested SSVD biomarker deviations contrasts the characteristic CSF profile in AD, i.e. depletion of amyloid beta peptide and increased phosphorylated and total tau. CONCLUSIONS: Combining SSVD and AD biomarkers may provide a powerful tool to identify with greater precision appropriate patients for clinical trials of more  homogeneous dementia populations. Thereby, biomarkers might promote therapeutic progress not only in VCI-SSVD, but also in AD. [SEP]\t\televated\n",

      "[CLS] Membrane proteins are targets of most available pharmaceuticals, but they are difficult to produce recombinantly, like many other aggregation-prone proteins.

Drp1 (Dynamin-related protein 1), a regulator of mitochondrial fission, shows neuroprotective effects on Parkinsons disease. In this study, we investigate the effect and mechanism of Drp1 on Aß42 transgenic Drosophila. [MASK] Elav-gal4/UAS>Aß42 transgenic Drosophila model was constructed using Elav-gal4 promoter. The effects of Drp1 on the lifespan, motor ability and neuronal degeneration of the transgenic Drosophila were explored by over-expressing Drp1 in the Aß42 transgenic Drosophila. ATP levels in the brain tissues of Aß42 transgenic Drosophila were detected using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). RESULTS: Exogenous expression of Drp1 promoted crawling ability, reduced the levels of ATP in Drosophila brain and suppressed the neuronal degeneration.

      "[CLS] G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are shown to be involved in Alzheimers d[MASK]ease (AD) pathogenes[MASK]. However, because GPCRs include a large family of membrane receptors, it [MASK] unclear which specific GPCR or pathway with rational ligands can become effective therapeutic targets for AD. Amylin receptor (AmR) [MASK] a GPCR that mediates several activities, such as improving glucose metabol[MASK]m, relaxing cerebrovascular structure, modulating inflammatory reactions and potentially enhancing neural regeneration. Recent studies show that peripheral treatments with amylin or its clinical analog, pramlintide, reduced several components of AD pathology, including amyloid plaques, tauopathy, neuroinflammation and other components in the brain, corresponding with improved  learning and memory in AD mouse models. Because amylin shares a similar secondary structure with amyloid-ß peptide (Aß), I propose that the AmR/GPCR pathway [MASK] d[MASK]turbed by a large amount of Aß in the AD brain, leading to tau phosphorylation, neuroinflammation and neuronal death in the pathological cascade.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Memory deficits are dominant in dementia and are positively correlated with electroencephalographic (EEG) beta power. EEG beta power can predict the progression of Alzheimer´s (AD) as early as at the stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and could possibly be used as surrogate marker for memory impairment. The objective of this study is to analyze the relationship between frontal and parietal EEG beta power and memory-test outcome. Frontal and  parietal beta power is analyzed for a resting state and an eyes-closed backward counting condition and related to memory impairment parameters. METHODS: A total of 28 right-handed female geriatric patients (mean age = 80.6) participated voluntarily in this study. Beta 1 (12.9-19.2 Hz) and beta 2 (19.2-32.4 Hz) EEG power at F3, F4, Fz, P3, P4, and Pz are correlated with immediate wordlist recall, delayed wordlist recall, recognition of learned words, and delayed figure recall. For classification between impaired and intact memory, we calculated a binary logistic regression model with memory impairment as a dependent variable and beta 2 power as an [MASK] variable. RESULTS: We found significant positive correlations between frontal and parietal  beta power and delayed memory recall. A significant correlation (Bonferroni correction, p < 0.05) was found at F4 beta 2 during backward counting. The binary logistic regression model with F4 beta 2 power during the counting condition as a predictor yielded a sensitivity of 76.9% (95% CI) and a specificity of 73.3% (95% CI) for classifying patients into \"verbal-memory impaired\" and \"intact.\" CONCLUSIONS: EEG beta 2 power recorded during a backward counting condition with  eyes closed can be used as surrogate marker for verbal memory impairment in geriatric patients. Antidepressant treatment was correlated with EEG data in resting state but not in counting condition. Further studies are necessary to verify the results of this pilot study. [SEP]\t\tindependent\n",

      "[CLS] Alzheimers disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting millions of patients worldwide. Previous studies have demonstrated alterations in the lipid composition of lipid extracts from plasma and brain samples of AD patients. However, there is [MASK] consensus regarding the qualitative and quantitative changes of lipids in brains from AD patients. In addition, the recent developments in imaging mass spectrometry methods are leading to a new stage in the in situ analysis of lipid species in brain tissue slices from human  postmortem samples. The present study uses the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI-IMS), permitting the direct anatomical analysis of lipids in postmortem brain sections from AD patients, which are compared with the intensity of the lipid signal in samples from matched subjects with [MASK] neurological diseases. The frontal cortex samples from AD patients were classified in three groups based on Braaks histochemical criteria, ranging from [MASK]n-cognitively impaired patients to those severely affected. The main results indicate a depletion of different sulfatide lipid species from the earliest stages of the disease in both white and gray matter areas of the frontal cortex. Therefore, the decrease in sulfatides in cortical areas could be considered as a marker of the disease, but may also indicate neurochemical modifications related to the pathogenesis of the disease.

      "[CLS] Alzheimers disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder of the elderly. As the prevalence of AD rises in the 21st century, there is an urgent need for the development of effective pharmacotherapies. Currently, drug treatments target the symptoms of the disease and do not modify or halt the disease progress. Thus, natural compounds have been investigated for their ability to treat AD. This review examines the efficacy of curcumin, a polyphenol derived from [MASK] herb, to treat AD. We summarize the in vivo and in vitro research describing the  mechanisms of action in which curcumin modifies AD pathology: curcumin inhibits the formation and promotes the disaggregation of amyloid-ß plaques, attenuates the hyperphosphorylation of tau and enhances its clearance, binds copper, lowers  cholesterol, modifies microglial activity, inhibits acetylcholinesterase, mediates the insulin signaling pathway, and is an antioxidant. In conclusion, curcumin has the potential to be more efficacious than current treatments. However, its usefulness as a therapeutic agent may be hindered by its low bioavailability. If the challenge of low bioavailability is overcome, curcumin-based medications for AD may be in the horizon. [SEP]\t\tturmeric\n",

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Episodic memory impairment is the core feature of typical Alzheimers disease. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of two commonly used verbal memory tests to detect mild [MASK] impairment due to Alzheimers disease (MCI-AD) and to predict progression to Alzheimers disease dementia (AD-d). METHODS: Prospective study of MCI patients in a tertiary memory disorder unit. Patients underwent an extensive neuropsychological battery including two tests of declarative verbal memory: The Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT) and the word list learning task from the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimers disease (CERAD-WL). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was obtained from all patients and MCI-AD was defined by means of the t-Tau/Aß1-42 ratio. Logistic regression analyses tested whether the combination of FCSRT and CERAD-WL measures significantly improved the prediction of MCI-AD. Progression to AD-d was analyzed in a Cox regression model. RESULTS: A total of 202 MCI patients with a mean follow-up of 34.2±24.2 months were included and 98 (48.5%) met the criteria for MCI-AD. The combination of FCSRT and CERAD-WL measures improved MCI-AD classification accuracy based on CSF  biomarkers. Both tests yielded similar global predictive values (59.9-65.3% and 59.4-62.8% for FCSRT and CERAD-WL, respectively). MCI-AD patients with deficits in both FCSRT and CERAD-WL had a faster progression to AD-d than patients with deficits in only one test. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of FCSRT and CERAD-WL improves the classification of MCI-AD and defines different prognostic profiles. These findings have important implications for clinical practice and the design of clinical trials. [SEP]\t\tcognitive\n",

      "[CLS] Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia among individuals 65 or older. There are more than 5 million diagnosed cases in the US alone and this  number is expected to triple by 2050. Therefore, AD has reached epidemic proportions with significant socioeconomic implications. While aging in general is the greatest risk factor for AD, several additional demographic factors that have contributed to the rise in AD in the US are under study. One such factor is  associated with the relatively fast growth of the [MASK] population. Several reports indicate that AD is more prevalent among blacks and [MASK]s. However, the reason for AD disparity among different ethnic groups is still poorly understood  and highly controversial. The [MASK] population is composed of different groups based on nationality, namely South and Central America, Mexico, and Caribbean Hispanics.

We argue that understanding the interplay between identified social determinants of health, co-morbidities, and genetic factors could lead to community empowerment and inclusiveness in research and healthcare  services, contributing to improved diagnosis and treatment of AD patients.

T helper 17 (Th17) cells are found in AD brain [MASK] and interleukin-17A (IL-17A) is identified around deposits of aggregated amyloid ß protein (Aß). However, the role of IL-17A in AD pathogenesis remains elusive. We overexpressed IL-17A in an AD mouse model via recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 5 (rAAV5)-mediated intracranial gene delivery. AD model mice subjected to injection of a vehicle (PBS) or rAAV5 carrying the lacZ gene served as controls. IL-17A did not exacerbate neuroinflammation in IL-17A-overexpressing mice. We found that IL-17A overexpression markedly improved glucose metabolism, decreased soluble Aß levels in the hippocampus and cerebrospinal fluid, drastically reduced cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and modestly but significantly improved anxiety and learning deficits. Moreover, the  ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 1 (ABCA1), which can transport Aß from the brain into the blood circulation, significantly increased in IL-17A-overexpressing mice. In vitro treatment of brain endothelial bEnd.3 cells  with IL-17A induced a dose-dependent increase in protein expression of ABCA1 through ERK activation.

We compared baseline and longitudinal clinical features in patients with primary AD neuropathology to those with primary non-AD  pathologies. We analyzed regional neuroanatomic disease burden in pathology-defined groups using postmortem neuropathologic data. RESULTS: A total of 19/34 patients had primary AD pathology and 15/34 had non-AD  pathology (13 frontotemporal lobar degeneration, 2 Lewy body disease). A total of 16/19 (84%) patients with AD had a logopenic spectrum phenotype; 5 met published  criteria for the logopenic variant (lvPPA), 8 had additional grammatical or semantic deficits (lvPPA+), and 3 had relatively preserved sentence repetition (lvPPA-). Sentence repetition was impaired in 68% of patients with PPA with AD pathology; forward digit span (DF) was impaired in 90%, substantially higher than in non-AD PPA (33%, p < 0.01). Lexical retrieval difficulty was common in all patients with PPA and did not discriminate between groups. Compared to non-AD, PPA with AD pathology had elevated microscopic neurodegenerative pathology in the superior/midtemporal gyrus, angular gyrus, and midfrontal cortex (p < 0.01). Low  DF scores correlated with high microscopic pathologic burden in superior/midtemporal and angular gyri (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Phonologic [MASK] dysfunction is a central feature of AD-associated PPA and specifically correlates with temporoparietal neurodegeneration.

      "[CLS] Alzheimers disease is an irreversible, progressive neurodegenerative disorder. The accumulation of Aß in the brain is thought to play a causative role in the development of cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimers disease. The p75 neurotrophin receptor is of great importance to protect against the Aß burden and its [MASK] is regulated by histone acetylation. This study investigated whether the phytochemical sulforaphane, a pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor, up-regulates the p75 neurotrophin receptor [MASK] via affecting histone acetylation in protection against Alzheimers disease. We found that sulforaphane ameliorated behavioral cognitive impairments and attenuated brain Aß burden in Alzheimers disease model mice. Additionally, sulforaphane reduced the [MASK] of histone  deacetylase1, 2, and 3, up-regulated p75 neurotrophin receptor, and increased levels of acetylated histone 3 lysine 9 and acetylated histone 4 lysine 12 in the cerebral cortex of Alzheimers disease model mice as well as in Aß-exposed SH-SY5Y cells. Furthermore, silencing of histone deacetylase1 and 3, but not histone deacetylase2, gene [MASK] with small interfering RNA caused up-regulation of p75 neurotrophin receptor in SH-SY5Y cells. In conclusion, this  study demonstrates that sulforaphane can ameliorate neurobehavioral deficits and  reduce the Aß burden in Alzheimers disease model mice, and the mechanism underlying these effects may be associated with up-regulation of p75 neurotrophin receptor mediated, apparently at least in part, via reducing the [MASK] of histone deacetylase1 and 3.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Neuropathologically, Alzheimers disease (AD) is characterized by accumulation of a 42 amino acid peptide called amyloid-ß (Aß42) in extracellular  senile plaques together with intraneuronal inclusions of hyperphosphorylated tau  protein in neurofibrillary tangles and neuronal degeneration. These changes are reflected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the volumes and production rates of which vary considerably between individuals, by reduced concentration of Aß42, increased concentration of phosphorylated tau (P-tau) protein, and increased concentration of total tau (T-tau) protein, respectively. OBJECTIVE: To examine the outstanding question if CSF concentrations of AD associated biomarkers are influenced by variations in CSF volumes, CSF production rate, and [MASK] pressure in healthy individuals. METHODS: CSF concentrations of Aß42, P-tau, and T-tau, as well as a number of other AD-related CSF biomarkers were analyzed together with [MASK] subarachnoid, ventricular, and spinal CSF volumes, as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging volumetric measurements, and CSF production rate in 19 cognitively normal healthy subjects (mean age 70.6, SD 3.6 years). RESULTS: Negative correlations were seen between the concentrations of three CSF  biomarkers (albumin ratio, Aß38, and Aß40), and ventricular CSF volume, but apart from this finding, no significant correlations were observed. CONCLUSION: These results speak against inter-individual variations in CSF volume and production rate as important confounds in the AD biomarker research field. [SEP]\t\tintracranial\n",

      "[CLS] AIM: The present study is aimed to investigate the ability of ciproxifan, a histamine H3 receptor antagonist to inhibit ß-amyloid (Aß)-induced neurotoxicity  in SK-N-SH cells and APP transgenic mouse model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vitro studies was designed to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of ciproxifan in Aß25-35 - induced SK-N-SH cells. For the in vivo study, ciproxifan (1 and 3mg/kg, i.p.) was administrated to transgenic mice for 15days and behaviour was assessed using the radial arm maze (RAM). Brain tissues were collected to measure Aß levels (Aß1-40 and Aß1-42), acetylcholine (ACh), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), nitric oxide (NO), lipid peroxidation (LPO),  [MASK] activities, cyclooxygenases (COX) and cytokines (IL-1a, IL-1ß and IL-6), while plasma was collected to measure TGF-1ß. RESULTS: The in vitro studies demonstrated neuroprotective effect of ciproxifan by increasing cell viability and inhibiting reactive oxygen species (ROS) in Aß25-35-induced SK-N-SH cells. Ciproxifan significantly improved the behavioural  parameters in RAM. Ciproxifan however, did not alter the Aß levels in APP transgenic mice. Ciproxifan increased ACh and showed anti-oxidant properties by reducing NO and LPO levels as well as enhancing [MASK] levels. The neuroinflammatory analysis showed that ciproxifan reduced both COX-1 and COX-2 activities, decreased the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1a, IL-1ß and IL-6 and increased the level of anti-inflammatory cytokine TGF-1ß.

      "[CLS] Chitinase activity is increased in Alzheimers disease (AD). However, the role of chitinase1 in AD is unknown. We investigated the effects of chitinase1 on Alzheimers pathology and microglia function. Artificial chitinase1 and chitinase inhibitor (chitinase-IN-2) were used to determine the effects of chitinase1 on inflammatory factors and ß-amyloid (Aß) oligomers deposition in D-galactose/AlCl3-induced rat model with cognitive impairments. Aß-treated N9 microglia cells were analyzed to further verify whether the changes in inflammatory factors following chitinase1 treatment were associated with microglia alternative activation. Our data displayed that the activity of chitinase1 was both improved in D-galactose/AlCl3-injected rats and Aß-pretreated microglia. [MASK] there was an improvement in cognitive function in chitinase1-treated AD rats. Furthermore, anti-inflammation factors (Arginase 1, Arg-1, mannose receptor type C 1, MRC1/CD206) were increased and pro-inflammation factors (tumor necrosis factor alpha, TNFa, interleukin 1 beta, IL-1ß) were decreased in D-galactose/AlCl3-induced AD rats with chitinase1 treatment. A higher level of M2 markers (Arg-1, MRC1/CD206) and a lower level of classic M1 markers (TNFa, IL-1ß) were obtained in Aß-pretreated N9 cells with chitinase1, suggesting that chitinase1 polarized the microglia into an anti-AD M2 phenotype.  We also detected that chitnase1 could weaken the deposition of Aß oligomers in the brain of D-galactose/ AlCl3-induced AD rats. In conclusion, Chitinase1 might  exert protective effects against AD by polarizing microglia to an M2 phenotype and resisting Aß oligomer deposition. [SEP]\t\tMoreover,\n",

      "[CLS] Purpose To assess the diagnostic performance of the callosal angle (CA) and Evans index (EI) measures and to determine their role versus automated volumetric methods in clinical radiology. Materials and Methods Magnetic resonance (MR) examinations performed before surgery (within 1-5 months of the MR examination) in 36 shunt-responsive patients with normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH; mean age, 75 years; age range, 58-87 years; 26 men, 10 women) and MR examinations of age- and sex-matched patients with Alzheimer disease (n = 34) and healthy control volunteers (n = 36) were studied. Three blinded observers independently measured  EI and CA for each patient. Volumetric segmentation of [MASK] gray matter, white  matter, ventricles, and hippocampi was performed by using software. These measures were tested by using multivariable logistic regression models to determine which combination of metrics is most accurate in diagnosis. Results The model that used CA and EI demonstrated 89.6%-93.4% accuracy and average area under the curve of 0.96 in differentiating patients with NPH from patients without NPH (ie, Alzheimer disease and healthy control). The regression model that used volumetric predictors of gray matter and white matter was 94.3% accurate. Conclusion CA and EI may serve as a screening tool to help the radiologist differentiate patients with NPH from patients without NPH, which would allow for designation of patients for further volumetric assessment. © RSNA, 2017.

In this review, we describe this field of science with particular reference to the advances that have been made over the last decade in  our understanding of its fundamental nature and consequences. We list the proteins that are known to be deposited as [MASK] or other types of aggregates in human tissues and the disorders with which they are associated, as well as the proteins that exploit the [MASK] motif to play specific functional roles in humans.

      "[CLS] Oligomeric forms of amyloid-forming proteins are believed to be the principal initiating bioactive species in many neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimers disease (AD). Amyloid-ß (Aß) oligomers are implicated in AD-associated phosphorylation and aggregation of the microtubule-associated protein tau. To investigate the specific molecular pathways activated by different assemblies, we isolated various forms of Aß from Tg2576 mice, which are a model for AD. We found that Aß*56, a 56-kDa oligomer that is detected before patients develop overt signs of AD, induced specific changes in neuronal signaling. In primary cortical neurons, Aß*56 interacted with N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), increased NMDAR-dependent Ca2+ influx, and consequently increased intracellular calcium concentrations and the activation of Ca2+-dependent calmodulin kinase IIa (CaMKIIa). In cultured neurons and in the brains of Tg2576 mice, activated CaMKIIa was associated with increased site-specific phosphorylation and missorting of [MASK] both of which are associated with AD pathology. In contrast, exposure of cultured primary cortical neurons to  other oligomeric Aß forms (dimers and trimers) did not trigger these effects.

Moreover, the neuronal injury was detected by Nissl staining. Meanwhile, the NeuN expression was examined in the hippocampus, the expression levels of Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-oxidase2(NOX2) was detected by immunofluorescence staining and western blot. The results showed that EA treatment significantly improved spatial learning and memory impairment in rats induced by Aß1-42.

More notably, EA treatment also effectively ameliorated neuronal injury and counteracted the aberrant increase of NOX2 levels in the hippocampus of AD rats. Our findings suggested that EA is a potential strategy for the treatment of AD, and the possible mechanism is associated with the alleviation of neuronal injury and inhibition of NOX2-related oxidative stress.

      "[CLS] Braak and Del Tredici have proposed that typical Parkinson disease (PD) has its origins in the olfactory bulb and gastrointestinal tract. However, the role of the olfactory system has insufficiently been explored in the pathogeneses of PD and Alzheimer disease (AD) in laboratory models. Here, we demonstrate applications of a new method to process mouse heads for microscopy by sectioning, mounting, and staining whole skulls (holocranohistochemistry). This technique permits the visualization of the olfactory system from the nasal cavity to mitral cells and dopamine-producing interneurons of glomeruli in the olfactory bulb. We  applied this method to two specific goals: first, to visualize [MASK] and AD-linked  gene expression in the olfactory system, where we detected abundant, endogenous a-synuclein and tau expression in the olfactory epithelium. Furthermore, we observed amyloid-ß plaques and proteinase-K-resistant a-synuclein species, respectively, in cranial nerve-I of APP- and human SNCA-over-expressing mice. The second application of the technique was to the modeling of gene-environment interactions in the nasal cavity of mice. We tracked the infection of a neurotropic respiratory-enteric-orphan virus from the nose pad into cranial nerves-I (and -V) and monitored the ensuing brain infection. Given its abundance  in the olfactory epithelia, we questioned whether a-synuclein played a role in innate host defenses to modify the outcome of infections. Indeed, Snca-null mice  were more likely to succumb to viral encephalitis versus their wild-type littermates.

      "[CLS] Late-onset Alzheimers disease (LOAD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder that corresponds to most Alzheimers disease (AD) cases. Inflammation is frequently related to AD, whereas microglial cells are the major phagocytes in the brain and mediate the removal of Aß peptides. Microglial cell dsyregulation might contribute to the formation of amyloid plaques, a hallmark of AD. Genome-wide association studies have reported genetic loci associated with the inflammatory pathway involved in AD. Among them, [MASK] CD33, rs3764650 ABCA7, rs6656401 CR1, and rs610932 MS4A6A variants in microglial genes are associated with LOAD. These variants are proposed to participate in the clearance of Aß peptides. However, their association with LOAD was not validated in all case-control studies. Thus, the present work aimed to assess the involvement of CD33 ([MASK]), ABCA7 (rs3764650), CR1 (rs6656401), and MS4A6A (rs610932) with  LOAD in a sample from southeastern Brazil. The genotype frequencies were assessed in 79 AD patients and 145 healthy elders matched for sex and age. We found that [MASK] CD33 acts as a protective factor against LOAD.

      "[CLS] Alteration [MASK] ryanodine receptor (RyR)-mediated calcium (Ca2+) signaling has been reported in Alzheimer disease (AD) models. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying altered RyR-mediated intracellular Ca2+ release in AD remain to be fully elucidated. We report here that RyR2 undergoes post-translational modifications (phosphorylation, oxidation, and nitrosylation) in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells expressing the ß-amyloid precursor protein (ßAPP) harboring the familial double Swedish mutations (APPswe). RyR2 macromolecular complex remodeling, characterized by depletion [MASK] the regulatory protein calstabin2, resulted in increased cytosolic Ca2+ levels and mitochondrial oxidative stress. We also report a functional interplay between amyloid ß (Aß), ß-adrenergic signaling, and altered Ca2+ signaling via leaky RyR2 channels. Thus, post-translational modifications [MASK] RyR occur downstream [MASK] Aß through a ß2-adrenergic signaling cascade that activates PKA. RyR2 remodeling in turn enhances ßAPP processing. Importantly, pharmacological stabilization [MASK] the binding [MASK] calstabin2 to RyR2 channels, which prevents Ca2+ leakage, or blocking  the ß2-adrenergic signaling cascade reduced ßAPP processing and the production [MASK] Aß in APPswe-expressing SH-SY5Y cells.

      "[CLS] The two main drivers of Alzheimers disease (AD), amyloid-ß (Aß) and hyperphosphorylated Tau (p-Tau) oligomers, cooperatively accelerate AD progression, but a hot debate is still ongoing about which of the two appears first. Here we present preliminary evidence showing that Tau and p-Tau are expressed by untransformed cortical adult human astrocytes in culture and that exposure of such cells to an Aß42 proxy, Aß25-35, which binds the [MASK] receptor (CaSR) and activates its signaling, significantly increases intracellular p-Tau levels, an effect CaSR antagonist (calcilytic) NPS 2143 wholly hinders. The astrocytes also release both Tau and p-Tau by means of exosomes into the extracellular medium, an activity that could mediate p-Tau diffusion within the brain. Preliminary data also indicate that exosomal levels of p-Tau increase after Aß25-35 exposure, but remain unchanged in cells pre-treated for 30-min with NPS 2143 before adding Aß25-35. Thus, our previous and present findings raise the unifying prospect that Aß•CaSR signaling plays a crucial role in AD development and progression by simultaneously activating (i) the amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor holoprotein, whose upshot is a  surplus production and secretion of Aß42 oligomers, and (ii) the GSK-3ß-mediated  increased production of p-Tau oligomers which are next released extracellularly inside exosomes. Therefore, as calcilytics suppress both effects on Aß42 and p-Tau metabolic handling, these highly selective antagonists of pathological Aß•CaSR signaling would effectively halt ADs progressive spread preserving patients cognition and life quality.

      "[CLS] Visual interpretation of 123I-ioflupane SPECT images has high diagnostic accuracy for differentiating parkinsonian syndromes (PS), from essential tremor and probable dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) from Alzheimer disease. In this study, we investigated the impact on accuracy and reader confidence offered by the addition of image quantification in comparison with visual interpretation alone.  Methods: We collected 304 123I-ioflupane images from 3 trials that included subjects with a clinical diagnosis of PS, non-PS (mainly essential tremor), probable DLB, and non-DLB (mainly Alzheimer disease). Images were reconstructed with standardized parameters before striatal binding ratios were quantified against a normal database. Images were assessed by 5 nuclear medicine physicians  who had limited prior experience with 123I-ioflupane interpretation. In 2 readings at least 1 mo apart, readers performed either a visual interpretation alone or a combined reading (i.e., visual plus quantitative data were available). Readers were asked to rate their confidence of image interpretation and judge scans as easy or difficult to read. Diagnostic accuracy was assessed by comparing image results with the standard of truth (i.e., diagnosis at follow-up) by [MASK] the positive percentage of agreement (equivalent to sensitivity) and the negative percentage of agreement (equivalent to specificity). The hypothesis  that the results of the combined reading were not inferior to the results of the  visual reading analysis was tested. Results: A comparison of the combined reading and the visual reading revealed a small, insignificant increase in the mean negative percentage of agreement (89.9% vs. 87.9%) and equivalent positive percentages of agreement (80.2% vs. 80.1%). Readers who initially performed a combined analysis had significantly greater accuracy (85.8% vs. 79.2%; P = 0.018), and their accuracy was close to that of the expert readers in the original studies (range, 83.3%-87.2%). Mean reader confidence in the interpretation of images showed a significant improvement when combined analysis  was used (P < 0.0001). Conclusion: The addition of quantification allowed readers with limited experience in the interpretation of 123I-ioflupane SPECT scans to have diagnostic accuracy equivalent to that of the experienced readers in the initial studies. Also, the results of the combined reading were not inferior to the results of the visual reading analysis and offered an increase in reader confidence. [SEP]\t\tmeasuring\n",

OBJECTIVE: To determine which demographic and biomarker factors differentiated [MASK] memory performers (aged 75+, [MASK] 20% for memory) from their peers and whether [MASK] memory performance was maintained over 3 years. METHODS: Clinically normal adults (n=125, CDR=0; age: 79.5±3.57 years) from the Harvard Aging Brain Study underwent cognitive testing and neuroimaging (amyloid PET, MRI) at baseline and 3-year follow-up. Participants were grouped into Optimal (n=25) vs. Typical (n=100) performers using performance on 3 challenging  memory measures. Non-parametric tests were used to compare groups. RESULTS: There were no differences in age, sex, or education between Optimal vs.  Typical performers. The Optimal group performed better in Processing Speed (p=0.016) and Executive Functioning (p<0.001). Optimal performers had larger hippocampal volumes at baseline compared with Typical Performers (p=0.027) but no differences in amyloid burden (p=0.442). Twenty-three of the 25 Optimal performers had longitudinal data and16 maintained [MASK] memory performance while 7  declined. Non-Maintainers additionally declined in Executive Functioning but not  Processing Speed. Longitudinally, there were no hippocampal volume differences between Maintainers and Non-Maintainers, however Non-Maintainers exhibited higher amyloid burden at baseline in contrast with Maintainers (p=0.008).

Evidence suggests that omega-3 fatty acids may act as  a possible [MASK] factor in AD. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the results available in the literature involving omega-3  fatty acids supplementation and its effect on cognitive function in AD patients. METHODS: A systematic review of MEDLINE (from PubMed), Excerpta Medica Database,  and Cochrane Library databases was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Inclusion criteria consisted in original intervention studies, controlled by placebo, that assessed  the impact of supplementation or dietary intake of omega-3 fatty acids on cognitive function, in humans with AD, without limitation for prime date of publication. RESULTS: Initial search resulted in 361 articles. Seven studies fully met the inclusion criteria. Most studies did not find statistically significant results for the omega-3 fatty acids supplementation compared to placebo, and those who show some benefit do it only in a few cognitive assessment scales. However, the effects of omega-3 fatty acids appear to be most effectively demonstrated in patients with very mild AD. CONCLUSION: The effects of omega-3 fatty acids supplementation in mild AD corroborate epidemiological observational studies showing that omega-3 fatty acids may be beneficial in disease onset, when there is slight impairment of brain function. Although some studies have shown changes in scales of cognitive function in more severe cases, they are not enough to support omega-3 fatty acids supplementation in the treatment of AD.

Recent developments in the field have tried to alleviate the problem of undefined MSE values for short signals. Moreover, there has been a recent interest in using other statistical moments than the mean, i.e., variance, in the coarse-graining step of the MSE. Building on these trends, here we introduce the so-called refined composite multiscale fuzzy entropy based on the standard deviation (RCMFEs) and mean (RCMFEµ) to quantify the dynamical properties of spread and mean, respectively, over multiple time scales. We demonstrate the dependency of the RCMFEs and RCMFEµ, in comparison with other multiscale approaches, on several straightforward signal processing concepts using a set of synthetic signals. The results evidenced that the RCMFEs  and RCMFEµ values are more stable and reliable than the classical multiscale entropy ones. We also inspect the ability of using the standard deviation as well as the mean in the coarse-graining process using magnetoencephalograms in Alzheimers disease and publicly available electroencephalograms recorded from focal and non-focal areas in epilepsy.

      "[CLS] The amyloid precursor protein (APP), a key player in Alzheimers disease, belongs to the family of synaptic adhesion molecules (SAMs) due to its impact on synapse  formation and synaptic plasticity. These functions are mediated by both the secreted APP ectodomain that acts as a neurotrophic factor and full-length APP forming trans-cellular dimers. Two homologs of APP exist in mammals: the APP like proteins APLP1 and APLP2, exhibiting functions that partly overlap with those of  APP. Here we tested whether APLP1 and APLP2 also show features of SAMs. We found  that all three family members were upregulated during postnatal development coinciding with synaptogenesis. We observed presynaptic and [MASK] localization of all APP family members and could show that heterologous expression of APLP1 or APLP2 in non-neuronal cells induces presynaptic differentiation in contacting axons of cocultured neurons, similar to APP and other SAMs. Moreover, APP/APLPs all bind to synaptic-signaling molecules, such as MINT/X11. Furthermore, we report that aged APLP1 knock-out mice show impaired basal transmission and a reduced mEPSC frequency, likely resulting from reduced spine density. This demonstrates an essential nonredundant function of APLP1 at the synapse. Compared to APP, APLP1 exhibits increased trans-cellular binding and elevated cell-surface levels due to reduced endocytosis. In conclusion, our results establish that APLPs show typical features of SAMs and indicate that increased surface expression, as observed for APLP1, is essential for proper synapse formation in vitro and synapse maintenance in vivoSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT  According to the amyloid-cascade hypothesis, Alzheimers disease is caused by the accumulation of Aß peptides derived from sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by ß-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and ?-secretase.  Here we show that all mammalian APP family members (APP, APLP1, and APLP2) exhibit synaptogenic activity, involving trans-synaptic dimerization, similar to  other synaptic cell adhesion molecules, such as Neuroligin/Neurexin. Importantly, our study revealed that the loss of APLP1, which is one of the major substrates of BACE1, causes reduced spine density in aged mice. Because some therapeutic interventions target APP processing (e.g., BACE inhibitors), those strategies may alter APP/APLP physiological function.

However, two-dimensional culture systems do not recapitulate the complexity of neural tissue, and phenotypes such as extracellular protein aggregation are difficult to observe. We report brain organoids that use pluripotent stem cells derived from AD patients and recapitulate AD-like pathologies such as amyloid aggregation, hyperphosphorylated tau protein, and endosome abnormalities.

Understanding the term neuroinflammation to encompass a broad range of [MASK]-specific conditions  is essential for finding effective therapeutic approaches for these pathologies.

      "[CLS] Serious brain disorders, such as the Alzheimers Disease (AD), are associated with a marked drop in the levels of important neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine (ACh). Real time monitoring of such biomarkers can therefore play a critical role in enhancing AD therapies by allowing timely diagnosis, verifications of treatment effectiveness, and developments of new medicines. In this study, we present the first acetylcholine/oxygen hybrid enzymatic fuel cell  for the self-powered on site detection of ACh in plasma, which is based on the combination of an enzymatic anode with a Pt cathode. Firstly, an effective acetylcholinesterase immobilized electrode was developed and its electrochemical  performance evaluated. Highly porous gold was used as the electrode material, and the enzyme was immobilized via a one step rapid and simple procedure that does not require the use of harsh chemicals or any electrode/enzyme pre-treatments. The resulting enzymatic electrode was subsequently used as the anode of a miniature flow-through membrane-less fuel cell and showed excellent response to varying concentrations of ACh. The peak power generated by the fuel cell was 4nW  at a voltage of 260mV and with a current density of 9µAcm-2. The limit of detection of the fuel cell sensor was 10µM, with an average response time as short as 3min. These [MASK] results open new horizons for point-of-care Alzheimer diagnosis and provide an attractive potential alternative to established methods that require laborious and time-consuming sample treatments and expensive instruments.

      "[CLS] Accumulation of amyloid-ß (Aß) peptide and deposition of hyperphosphorylated tau  protein are two major pathological hallmarks of Alzheimers disease [MASK] Glycogen synthase kinase-3ß (GSK3ß) is increasingly thought to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of AD, both as a regulator of the production of Aß and through its well-established role on tau phosphorylation. The phosphoinositide 3  kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway plays an import role in neuronal survival and cognitive function, and is known as an upstream element of GSK3ß. Fuzhisan (FZS), a Chinese herbal complex prescription, has been used for the treatment of AD for over 20years, and is known to enhance the cognitive ability in AD patients as well as  in AD model rats. However, it still remains unclear whether FZS is responsible for regulation of PI3K/AKT/GSK3ß signaling and contributes to subsequent down-regulation of Aß and phosphorylated tau. Thus, we treated APP/PS1 transgenic mice, a useful model of AD-related memory impairment, with FZS by intragastrical  administration for 60days and Donepezil was used as a positive control. The results showed that treatment with FZS significantly reversed the memory deficit  in the Tg APP/PS1 mice in the Morris water maze test. Moreover, FZS significantly attenuated Aß production through inhibition of APP procession and phosphorylation of tau in the hippocampus of Tg APP/PS1 mice. In addition, FZS treatment also increased PI3K and pSer473-AKT levels, inhibited GSK3ß activity by increasing phosphorylation of GSK3ß at Ser9. These results indicated that the memory ameliorating effect of FZS may be, in part, by regulation the PI3K/AKT/GSK3ß signaling which may contribute to down-regulation of Aß and tau hyperphosphorylation.

Axonal and synaptic pathology is an important feature of Lewy body dementias (LBD), but the state of CRMP2 phosphorylation (pCRMP2) as well as its correlations with markers of neurodegeneration have not been studied in these dementias. Hence, we measured CRMP2 phosphorylation at Thr509, Thr514 and Ser522, as well as markers of ß-amyloid (Aß), tau-phosphorylation, a-synuclein and synaptic function in the postmortem neocortex of a longitudinally assessed cohort of LBD patients characterized by low (Parkinsons disease dementia, PDD) and high (dementia with Lewy bodies, DLB) burden of Alzheimer type pathology. We found specific increases of pCRMP2 at Thr514 in DLB, but not PDD. The increased CRMP2 phosphorylation correlated with fibrillogenic Aß as well as with losses of markers for axon regeneration (ß-III-tubulin) and synaptic integrity (synaptophysin) in LBD. In contrast, pCRMP2 alterations did not correlate with tau-phosphorylation or a-synuclein, and also appear unrelated to immunoreactivities of putative upstream kinases glycogen synthase kinase 3ß and cyclin-dependent kinase 5, as well as to protein phosphatase 2A. In conclusion, increased pCRMP2 may underlie the axonal pathology of DLB, and may be a novel therapeutic target.

In our study, we first analyzed the relationship between the inflammatory activation and autophagy in brains derived from aged mice and LPS-injected inflammatory mouse models. We found that inflammatory activation was essential for activation [MASK] autophagy in the brain, which was neuronal ATG5-dependent. Next, we found that autophagy in cultured neurons was enhanced by LPS treatment [MASK] cocultured macrophages. In further experiments designed to provoke chronic mild stimulation [MASK] TLR4 without inducing obvious neuroinflammation, we gave repeated LPS injections (i.p., 0.15 mg/kg, weekly for  3 mo) to transgenic mice overexpressing human Tau mutant (P301S) in neurons.

Magnetite can have potentially large impacts on the brain due  to its unique combination of redox activity, surface charge, and strongly magnetic behavior. We used magnetic analyses and electron microscopy to identify  the abundant presence in the brain of magnetite nanoparticles that are consistent with high-temperature formation, suggesting, therefore, an external, not internal, source. Comprising a separate nanoparticle population from the euhedral particles ascribed to endogenous sources, these brain magnetites are often found  with other transition metal nanoparticles, and they display rounded crystal morphologies and fused surface textures, reflecting crystallization upon cooling  from an initially heated, iron-bearing source material.

      "[CLS] A key pathology of Alzheimers disease (AD) is amyloid ß (Aß) accumulation that triggers synaptic impairments and neuronal death. Metabolic disruption is common  in AD and recent evidence implicates impaired leptin function in AD. Thus the leptin system may be a novel therapeutic target in AD. Indeed, leptin has cognitive enhancing properties and it prevents the aberrant effects of Aß on hippocampal synaptic function and neuronal viability. However, as leptin is a large peptide, development of smaller leptin-mimetics may be the best therapeutic approach. Thus, we have examined the cognitive enhancing and neuroprotective properties of known bioactive leptin fragments. Here we show that the leptin (116-130) fragment, but not leptin (22-56), mirrored the ability of leptin to promote AMPA receptor trafficking to synapses and facilitate activity-dependent hippocampal synaptic plasticity.

Objectives: To determine whether young blood plasma ameliorates pathology and cognition in a mouse model for AD and could be a possible future treatment for the disease. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this preclinical study, mice that harbor a  human mutant APP gene, which causes familial AD, were aged to develop AD-like disease including accumulation of amyloid plaques, loss of synaptic and neuronal  proteins, and behavioral deficits. The initial parabiosis studies were done in 2010, and the final studies were conducted in 2014. Alzheimer disease model mice  were then treated either by surgically connecting them with a young healthy mouse, thus providing a shared blood circulation through parabiosis, or through repeated injections of plasma from young mice. Main Outcomes and Measures: Neuropathological parameters and changes in hippocampal gene expression in response to the treatment were assessed. In addition, cognition was tested in AD model mice intravenously injected with young blood plasma. Results: Aged mutant amyloid precursor protein mice with established disease showed a near complete restoration in levels of synaptic and neuronal proteins after exposure to young blood in parabiosis (synaptophysin P?=?.02; calbindin P?=?.02) or following intravenous plasma administration (synaptophysin P < .001;  calbindin P?=?.14).

We hypo[MASK]sized that selective CC degeneration is associated with memory impairment in AD and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), which is mediated by homotopic inter-hemispheric functional dysconnectivity. Using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and task-free functional MRI, we assessed [MASK] CC volume and inter-hemispheric FC in 66 healthy controls, 41 aMCI and 41 AD. As expected, AD had CC degeneration and attenuated inter-hemispheric homotopic FC. Never[MASK]less, aMCI had relatively less severe CC degeneration (mainly in mid-anterior, central, and mid-posterior) and no reduction in inter-hemispheric homotopic FC. The degeneration of each CC sub-region was associated with specific inter-hemispheric homotopic functional disconnections in AD and aMCI. More importantly, impairment of inter-hemispheric  homotopic FC partially mediated [MASK] association between CC (particularly [MASK] central and posterior parts) degeneration and memory deficit. Notably, [MASK]se results remained after controlling for hippocampal volume. Our findings shed light on how CC degeneration and [MASK] related inter-hemispheric FC impact memory impairment in early stage of AD. [SEP]\t\tthe\n",

In the current study, the neuroprotective effects and underlying mechanisms [MASK] Z-LIG against fibrillar aggregates [MASK] Aß25-35 and Aß1-42-induced neurotoxicity were investigated in both SH-SY5Y cells and differentiated PC12 cells. Z-LIG at 1-30 µM provided an effective neuroprotection, as evidenced by the increase in cell viability, as well as the decrease in LDH release and intracellular accumulation [MASK] reactive oxygen species. Additionally, Z-LIG markedly blocked Aß  fibrils-induced condensed nuclei and sub-G1 accumulation suggestive [MASK] apoptosis. Furthermore, Z-LIG substantially reversed the activation [MASK] phosphorylated p38 and the inhibition [MASK] phosphorylated Akt caused by Aß25-35.

      "[CLS] OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whe[MASK]r a model that was previously developed to predict 14-day mortality for nursing home residents with dementia and lower respiratory tract infection who received antibiotics could be applied to residents who were not treated with antibiotics. Specifically, in this same data set, to update [MASK]  model using recalibration methods; and subsequently examine [MASK] historical, geographical, methodological and spectrum transportability through external validation of [MASK] updated model. DESIGN: 1 cohort study was used to develop [MASK] prediction model, and 4 cohort studies from 2 countries were used for [MASK] external validation of [MASK] model. SETTING: Nursing homes in [MASK] Ne[MASK]rlands and [MASK] USA. PARTICIPANTS: 157 untreated residents were included in [MASK] development of [MASK] model; 239 untreated residents were included in [MASK] external validation cohorts. OUTCOME: Model performance was evaluated by assessing discrimination: area under  [MASK] receiver operating characteristic curves; and calibration: Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness-of-fit statistics and calibration graphs. Fur[MASK]r, reclassification tables allowed for a comparison of patient classifications between models. RESULTS: The original prediction model applied to [MASK] untreated residents, who were sicker, showed excellent discrimination but poor calibration, underestimating mortality. Adjusting [MASK] intercept improved calibration. Recalibrating [MASK] slope did not substantially improve [MASK] performance of [MASK] model. Applying [MASK] updated model to [MASK] o[MASK]r 4 data sets resulted in acceptable discrimination. Calibration was inadequate only in one data set that differed substantially from [MASK] o[MASK]r data sets in case-mix. Adjusting [MASK] intercept for this population again improved calibration. CONCLUSIONS: The discriminative performance of [MASK] model seems robust for differences between settings. To improve calibration, we recommend adjusting [MASK]  intercept when applying [MASK] model in settings where different mortality rates are expected. An impact study may evaluate [MASK] usefulness of [MASK] two prediction models for treated and untreated residents and whe[MASK]r it supports decision-making in clinical practice. [SEP]\t\tthe\n",

      "[CLS] Neurotransmission mediated by acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) plays an important  role in learning and memory functions in the hippocampus. Impairment of the cholinergic system contributes to Alzheimers disease (AD), indicating the importance of AChRs as drug targets for AD. To improve the success rates for AD drug development, human cell models that mimic the target brain region are important. Therefore, we characterized the functional expression of nicotinic and muscarinic AChRs (nAChRs and mAChRs, respectively) in human hippocampal neurons differentiated from hippocampal neural stem/progenitor cells (HIP-009 cells). Intracellular calcium flux in 4-week differentiated HIP-009 cells demonstrated that the cells responded to acetylcholine, nicotine, and muscarine in a concentration-dependent manner (EC50 = 13.4 ± 0.5, 6.0 ± 0.4, and 35.0 ± 2.5 µM,  respectively). In addition, assays using subtype-selective compounds revealed that major AD therapeutic target AChR subtypes-a7 and a4ß2 nAChRs, as well as M1  and M3 mAChRs-were expressed in the cells. Furthermore, neuronal network analysis demonstrated that potentiation of M3 mAChRs inhibits the spontaneous firing of HIP-009 neurons. These results indicate that HIP-009 cells are physiologically [MASK] for AD drug screening and hence are loadstars for the establishment of in vitro AD models. [SEP]\t\trelevant\n",

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Familial Alzheimers disease (FAD) is caused by mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) or presenilin (PS). Most PS mutations, which account for the majority of FAD cases, lead to an increased ratio of longer to shorter forms of the amyloid beta (Aß) peptide. The therapeutic rationale of ?-secretase modulators (GSMs) for Alzheimers disease is based on this genetic evidence as well as on enzyme kinetics measurements showing changes in the processivity of the ?-secretase complex. This analysis suggests that GSMs could potentially offset some of the effects of PS mutations on APP processing, thereby addressing the root cause of early onset FAD. Unfortunately, the field [MASK] generated few, if any, molecules with good central nervous system (CNS) drug-like properties to enable proof-of-mechanism studies. METHOD: We characterized the novel GSM FRM-36143 using multiple cellular assays to determine its in vitro potency and off-target activity as well as its potential to reverse the effect of PS mutations. We also tested its efficacy in vivo in wild-type mice and rats. RESULTS: FRM-36143 [MASK] much improved CNS drug-like properties compared to published GSMs. It [MASK] an in vitro EC50 for Aß42 of 35 nM in H4 cells, can reduce Aß42 to 58 % of the baseline in rat cerebrospinal fluid, and also increases the non-amyloidogenic peptides Aß37 and Aß38. It does not inhibit Notch processing, nor does it inhibit 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR24) activity. Most interestingly, it can reverse the effects of presenilin mutations on APP processing in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: FRM-36143 possesses all the characteristics of a GSM in terms of Aß  modulation Because FRM-36143 was able to reverse the effect of PS mutations, we suggest that targeting patients with this genetic defect would be the best approach at testing the efficacy of a GSM in the clinic. While the amyloid hypothesis is still being tested with ß-site APP-cleaving enzyme inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies in sporadic AD, we believe it is not a hypothesis for FAD.  Since GSMs can correct the molecular defect caused by PS mutations, they have the promise to provide benefits to the patients when treated early enough in the course of the disease. [SEP]\t\thas\n",

      "[CLS] INTRODUCTION: Some Alzheimers disease (AD) patients die without ever developing  cognitively impaired basic activities of daily living (basic ADL), which may reflect slower disease progression or better compensatory mechanisms. Although impaired basic ADL is related to disease severity, it may exert an independent risk for death. This study examined the association [MASK] impaired basic ADL and survival of AD patients, and proposed a multistate approach for modeling the  time to death for patients who demonstrate different patterns of progression of AD that do or do not include basic ADL impairment. METHODS: 1029 patients with probable AD at the Baylor College of Medicine Alzheimers Disease and Memory Disorders Center met the criteria for this study.  Two complementary definitions were used to define development of basic ADL impairment using the Physical Self-Maintenance Scale score. A weighted Cox regression model, including a time-dependent covariate (development of basic ADL  impairment), and a multistate survival model were applied to examine the effect of basic ADL impairment on survival. RESULTS: As expected decreased ability to perform basic ADL at baseline, age at initial visit, years of education, and sex were all associated with significantly higher mortality risk. In those unimpaired at baseline, the development of basic  ADL impairment was also associated with a much greater risk of death (hazard ratios 1.77-4.06) over and above the risk conferred by loss of MMSE points. A multi-state Cox model, controlling for those other variables quantified the substantive increase in hazard ratios for death conferred by the development of basic ADL impairment by two definitions and can be applied to calculate the short term risk of mortality in individual patients. CONCLUSIONS: The current study demonstrates that the presence of basic ADL impairment or the development of such impairments are important predictors of death in AD patients, regardless of severity.

      "[CLS] Recently researchers proposed the term Type-3-Diabetes for Alzheimers disease  (ad) because of the shared molecular and cellular features among Type-1-Diabetes, Type-2-Diabetes and insulin resistance associated with memory deficits and cognitive decline in elderly individuals. Recent clinical and basic studies on patients with diabetes and AD revealed previously unreported cellular and pathological among diabetes, insulin resistance and AD. These studies are also strengthened by various basic biological studies that decipher the effects of insulin in the pathology of AD through cellular and molecular mechanisms. For instance, insulin is involved in the activation of glycogen synthase kinase 3ß, which in turn causes phosphorylation of tau, which involved in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. Interestingly, insulin also plays a crucial role in the  formation amyloid plaques.

      "[CLS] This study aims to develop a composite biomarker that can accurately measure the  sequential biological stages of Alzheimers disease (AD) on an individual level.  We selected 144 subjects from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 2 datasets. Ten biomarkers, from brain function and structure, cerebrospinal [MASK] and cognitive performance, were integrated using the event-based probabilistic model to estimate their optimal temporal sequence (Soptimal). We identified the numerical order of the Soptimal as the characterizing Alzheimers disease risk events (CARE) index to measure disease stage. The results show that, in the Soptimal, hippocampal and posterior cingulate cortex network biomarkers occur first, followed by aberrant cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-ß and p-tau levels, then  cognitive deficit, and finally regional gray matter loss and fusiform network abnormality. The CARE index significantly correlates with disease severity and exhibits high reliability. Our findings demonstrate that use of the CARE index would advance AD stage measurement across the whole AD continuum and facilitate personalized treatment of AD. [SEP]\t\tfluid,\n",

      "[CLS] It has been demonstrated using Aß40 and Aß42 recombinant and synthetic peptides that [MASK] fibrils are formed of complete oligomer ring structures. Such ring structures have a diameter of about 8-9?nm, an oligomer height of about 2- 4?nm,  and an internal diameter of the ring of about 3-4?nm. Oligomers associate in a fibril in such a way that they interact with each other, overlapping slightly. There are differences in the packing of oligomers in fibrils of recombinant and synthetic Aß peptides. The principal difference is in the degree of orderliness of ring-like oligomers that leads to generation of morphologically different fibrils. Most ordered association of ring-like structured oligomers is observed for a recombinant Aß40 peptide. Less ordered fibrils are observed with the synthetic Aß42 peptide. Fragments of fibrils the most protected from the action of proteases have been determined by tandem mass spectrometry. It was shown that  unlike Aß40, fibrils of Aß42 are more protected, showing less ordered organization compared to that of Aß40 fibrils.

OBJECTIVE: To test [MASK] hypo[MASK]sis that a high-salt diet regimen influences [MASK] accumulation of amyloid-ß (Aßand CBF) and CBF, exacerbates cognitive decline, and increases [MASK] propensity to AD. METHODS: Double transgenic mice harboring [MASK] amyloid-ß protein precursor (APPswe), and presenilin-1 (PSEN1) along with control littermates, 2 months of age at initiation of special diet, were divided into 4 groups: Group A, APP/PS1 and Group B, controls fed a high-sodium (4.00%) chow diet for 3 months; Group C,  APP/PS1 and Group D, controls fed a low-sodium (0.08%) regular chow diet for 3 months. Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and CBF were measured noninvasively using [MASK] tail MAP measurement device and magnetic resonance imaging, respectively. Aß plaques numbers in [MASK] cortex and hippocampus of APP/PS1 were quantified. RESULTS: In contrary to controls, APP/PS1 mice fed a high-salt diet did not show  markedly elevated mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure (134±4.8 compared with 162±2.8 mmHg, and 114±5.0 compared with 137±20 mmHg, p<?0.0001). However, a  high-salt diet increased CBF in both APP/PS1 and controls and did not alter [MASK] cerebral tissue integrity. Aß plaques were significantly reduced in [MASK] cortex and hippocampus of mice fed a high-salt diet.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Concomitant Alzheimers disease (AD) pathology is observed in Lewy body diseases (LBD), but the clinical impact is unknown. Only a few biomarker studies in LBD exist and have included small cohorts from single centers. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers across the spectrum of LBD in a large multicenter cohort and  to assess whether an AD biomarker profile was associated with demographic and clinical differences in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). METHODS: We included 375 DLB patients, 164 Parkinsons disease (PD) patients without dementia, and 55 PD patients with dementia (PDD) from 10 centers. CSF amyloid-beta42 (Aß42), total tau (t-tau), and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) values were dichotomized as abnormal or normal according to locally available cut-off values. A CSF AD profile was defined as abnormal Aß42 combined with abnormal t-tau [MASK] p-tau. RESULTS: A substantial proportion of DLB patients had abnormal values for CSF Aß42, t-tau, and p-tau, while abnormal values were uncommon in PD without dementia. Patients with PDD had values in between. A CSF AD profile was observed  in 25% of DLB patients, compared with only 9% of PDD and 3% of PD without dementia. Within DLB, patients with a CSF AD profile were older, more often female, performed worse on the Mini-Mental State Examination, and had shorter disease duration compared with patients with normal CSF. CONCLUSION: A CSF AD profile is more common in DLB compared with PDD and PD, and  is associated with more severe cognitive impairment in DLB. [SEP]\t\tand/or\n",

      "[CLS] Alzheimers disease (AD) is a most common neurodegenerative [MASK] which associates with impaired cognition. Gut microbiota can modulate host brain function and behavior via microbiota-gut-brain axis, including cognitive behavior. Germ-free animals, antibiotics, probiotics intervention and diet can induce alterations of gut microbiota and gut physiology and also host cognitive behavior, increasing or decreasing risks of AD. The increased permeability of intestine and blood-brain barrier induced by gut microbiota disturbance will increase the incidence of neurodegeneration disorders. Gut microbial metabolites  and their effects on host neurochemical changes may increase or decrease the risk of AD. Pathogenic microbes infection will also increase the risk of AD, and meanwhile, the onset of AD support the \"hygiene hypothesis\". All the results suggest that AD may begin in the gut, and is closely related to the imbalance of  gut microbiota.

RESULTS: Patients who [MASK] ChEI therapy after the introduction of the coverage policy had a significantly longer persistence. Median ChEI persistence until discontinuation or death was 9.37 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 9.0-39.7)  and 17.6 months (95% CI 16.9-18.3) in patients who [MASK] therapy before and after the new policy, respectively.

      "[CLS] Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, yet there are no therapeutic treatments that can either cure or delay its onset. Currently, the pathogenesis of AD is still uncertain, especially with respect to how the disease develops from a normal healthy brain. Amyloid ß oligomers (AßO) are highly neurotoxic proteins and are considered potential initiators to the pathogenesis of AD. Rat brains were exposed to AßO via bilateral intracerebroventricular injections. Rats were then euthanized at either 1, 3, 7 or 21-days post surgery.  Rat behavioural testing was performed using the Morris water maze and open field  tests. Post-mortem brain tissue was immunolabelled for Aß, microglia, and cholinergic neurons. Rats exposed to AßO showed deficits in spatial learning and  anxiety-like behaviour. Acute positive staining for Aß was only observed in the corpus callosum surrounding the lateral ventricles. AßO exposed rat brains also showed a delayed increase in activated microglia within the corpus callosum and a decreased number of cholinergic neurons within the basal forebrain. Acute exposure to AßO resulted in mild learning and memory impairments with co-concomitant white matter pathology within the corpus callosum and cholinergic  cell loss within the basal forebrain. [MASK] suggest that acute exposure to AßO  in the rat may be a useful tool in assessing the early phases for the pathogenesis of AD. [SEP]\t\tResults\n",

      "[CLS] Many current tandem mass spectrometry (MS) methods for measuring phosphatidylcholines (PtdChos) rely only on precursor ion scanning of the common  184?m/z phosphocholine fragment with positive electrospray ionization (+ESI), and thus measure pools of PtdChos rather than specific isoforms. In this paper, we developed and compared an isotope dilution, tandem MS method capable of quantifying PtdChos based on specific fatty acid side-chains to the traditional 184?m/z method. The method is based on the detection of PtdCho ammonium formate (AmF) adduct as parent ions and fatty acid fragment daughter ions under negative  electrospray ionization (-ESI). Accuracy, imprecision, and recovery were below 15 %, with acceptable linearity (R 2?>?0.99) up to 5 µg/mL. We used the method to analyze the [MASK] of PtdChos with common side-chain combinations among 60 subjects and showed that it was possible for two individuals to have the same PtdCho pool concentration based on detection of the 184?m/z fragment, but up to a fourfold difference in the levels of specific isoforms comprising the pool based  on our method. We then compared the results of both methods across 572 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimers disease (AD), or no impairment  (NI), which showed that statistically significant associations between specific PtdCho isoforms and AD were masked with the 184?m/z method. Our findings demonstrate the importance of isoform specificity for quantifying PtdChos, and suggest caution when interpreting analytical data based on pools of biomarkers. [SEP]\t\tdistributions\n",

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Accurately identifying gene regulatory network is an important task in understanding in vivo biological activities. The inference of such networks is often accomplished through the use of gene expression data. Many methods have been developed to evaluate gene expression dependencies between transcription factor and its target genes, and some methods also eliminate transitive interactions. The regulatory (or edge) direction is undetermined if the target gene is also a transcription factor. Some methods predict the regulatory directions in the gene regulatory networks [MASK] locating the eQTL single nucleotide polymorphism, or [MASK] observing the gene expression changes when knocking out/down  the candidate transcript factors; regrettably, these additional data are usually  unavailable, especially for the samples deriving from human tissues. RESULTS: In this study, we propose the Context Based Dependency Network (CBDN), a method that is able to infer gene regulatory networks with the regulatory directions from gene expression data only. To determine the regulatory direction, CBDN computes the influence of source to target [MASK] evaluating the magnitude changes of expression dependencies between the target gene and the others with conditioning on the source gene. CBDN extends the data processing inequality [MASK] involving the dependency direction to distinguish between direct and transitive relationship between genes. We also define two types of important regulators which can influence a majority of the genes in the network directly or indirectly. CBDN can detect both of these two types of important regulators [MASK] averaging the influence functions of candidate regulator to the other genes. In our experiments with simulated and real data, even with the regulatory direction  taken into account, CBDN outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches for inferring gene regulatory network. CBDN identifies the important regulators in the predicted network: 1. TYROBP influences a batch of genes that are related to  Alzheimers disease; 2. ZNF329 and RB1 significantly regulate those mesenchymal gene expression signature genes for brain tumors. CONCLUSION: By merely leveraging gene expression data, CBDN can efficiently infer the existence of gene-gene interactions as well as their regulatory directions. The constructed networks are helpful in the identification of important regulators for complex diseases. [SEP]\t\tby\n",

Non-fasting serum (150 AD cases 150 controls) and plasma (100 AD cases, 100 controls) IL-7 levels were assayed via electrochemiluminescence. The correlation  between serum and plasma for IL-7 was 0.34. In the total sample, serum (r(2)=0.16, p=0.006) and plasma (r(2)=-0.20, p=0.007) IL-7 levels were significantly, but inversely, correlated with GDS-30 [MASK] When split by gender, serum IL-7 levels were significantly positively associated with GDS scores among men (r(2)=0.34, p=0.001) whereas plasma IL-7 levels (r(2)=-0.23, p=0.008) were significantly negatively associated with GDS scores among women. A  logistic regression model predicting depression status (GDS30>=10) included age,  gender, education, plasma, and serum IL-7 levels, found both significantly associated with depression status, but in opposite directions. Our findings support a significant link between IL-7 and depression; however, we further highlight the importance of blood fraction and gender when examining this relationship. Additionally, these findings further support the need for additional work that could lead to targeted therapeutic interventions utilizing anti-inflammatory medications for individuals with depression.

      "[CLS] The targeting of two independent but synergistic enzymatic activities, histone deacetylases (HDACs, class I and HDAC6) and phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5), has recently been validated as a potentially novel therapeutic approach for Alzheimers disease (AD). Here we report the discovery of a new first-in-class small-molecule (CM-414) that acts as a dual inhibitor of PDE5 and HDACs. We have  used this compound as a chemical probe to validate this systems therapeutics strategy, where an increase in the activation of cAMP/cGMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) induced by PDE5 inhibition, combined with moderate HDAC class I inhibition, leads to efficient histone acetylation. This molecule rescued the impaired long-term potentiation evident in hippocampal slices from APP/PS1 mice. Chronic treatment of Tg2576 mice with CM-414 diminished brain Aß and tau phosphorylation (pTau) levels, increased the inactive form of GSK3ß, reverted the decrease in dendritic spine density on hippocampal neurons, and reversed their cognitive deficits, at least in part by inducing the expression of genes related to synaptic transmission. Thus, CM-414 may serve as the starting point to discover balanced dual inhibitors with an [MASK] efficacy and safety profile for clinical testing on AD patients. [SEP]\t\toptimal\n",

      "[CLS] OBJECTIVES: Aging entails deterioration in sensory, physical, and cognitive functions, raising doubt in the driving capacity of older drivers, especially when the deficits are severe, as in dementia. Many older drivers, especially women, adapt their driving habits in order to compensate for these deficits and [MASK] stop driving. The present prospective study assessed driving cessation in men and women throughout the dementia process, including a 2-year pre-dementia phase. METHODS: The study was based on a three-city cohort of subjects who were aged 65?years and older in 2000 and followed for more than 10?years. Active dementia detection was conducted at each follow-up. The probability of driving cessation was assessed in men and women during the 2-year pre-dementia phase and until 5?years after diagnosis. RESULTS: In the 2-year pre-dementia phase, both men and women ceased driving earlier than drivers with no central nervous system pathology (p?<?0,001), and women ceased driving earlier than men. A total of 45% of men and 74% of women had already ceased driving at dementia diagnosis. In contrast, the probability of cessation within 3?years after diagnosis was similar between men and women. CONCLUSION: The study showed that, in this French urban population, few demented  drivers, especially women, were still driving after diagnosis. Those who continued to drive 3?years after the diagnosis all had Alzheimer-type dementia. There is certainly a need for physicians to help these drivers to adapt their driving activity to their deficits and to prepare them to stop driving. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Renal function declines according to age and vascular risk factors, whereas few data are available regarding genetically-mediated effects of anti-hypertensives over renal function. OBJECTIVE: To estimate urea and creatinine variations in dementia due to Alzheimer disease (AD) by way of a pharmacogenetic analysis of the anti-hypertensive effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis). METHODS: Consecutive outpatients older than 60 years-old with AD and no history of kidney transplant or dialytic [MASK] were recruited for prospective correlations regarding variations in fasting blood levels of urea and creatinine  in one year, considering ACE genotypes of rs1800764 and rs4291 and their respective haplotypes, and treatment with ACEis along with blood pressure variations. RESULTS: For 190 patients, 152 had arterial hypertension, and 122 used ACEis. Minor allele frequencies were 0.492 for rs1800764-C and 0.337 for rs4291-T, both  in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. There were no overall significant yearly variations in levels of urea and creatinine, but their concurrent variations were positively correlated (? <0.0001). Each A allele of rs4291 led to an yearly urea  increase of 3,074 mg/dL, and an yearly creatinine increase of 0.044 mg/dL, while  the use of ACEis was protective regarding creatinine variations. The use of ACEis was also protective for carriers of rs1800764-CT/rs4291-AA, while carriers of rs1800764-CT/rs4291-AT had steeper reductions in creatinine levels, particularly  when they were treated with ACEis.

      "[CLS] Alzheimers disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that targets  memory and cognition, and is the most common form of dementia among the elderly.  Although AD itself has been extensively studied, very little is known about early-stage preclinical events and/or mechanisms that may underlie AD pathogenesis. Since the majority of AD cases are sporadic in nature, advancing age remains the greatest known risk factor for AD. However, additional environmental and epigenetic factors are thought to accompany increasing age to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of AD. Postoperative cognitive delirium (POD) is a behavioral syndrome that primarily occurs in elderly patients following a surgical procedure or injury and is characterized by disruptions in cognition. Individuals that experience POD are at an increased risk for developing dementia and AD compared to normal aging individuals. One way in which cognitive function is affected in cases of POD is through activation of the inflammatory cascade following surgery or injury. There is compelling evidence that immune challenges (surgery and/or injury) associated with POD [MASK] the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines into both the periphery and central nervous system. Thus, it is possible that cognitive impairments following an inflammatory episode may lead to more severe forms of dementia and AD pathogenesis. Here we will discuss the inflammation associated with POD, and highlight the advantages of using POD as a model to study inflammation-evoked cognitive impairment. We will explore the possibility that advancing age and immune challenges may provide mechanistic evidence correlating early life POD with AD. We will review and propose neural mechanisms by which cognitive impairments occur in cases of POD, and discuss how POD may augment the onset of AD. [SEP]\t\ttrigger\n",

      "[CLS] Sundowning syndrome (SDS) in patients with Alzheimers disease (AD) is [MASK] by the intensification of behavioral disorders at sunset. Despite SDS etiology being unclear, a strong relationship between high cortisol levels and SDS has been reported. Aerobic exercise (AE) and cognitive training (CT) can  reduce cortisol levels. However, whether SDS would benefit from AE and CT is still unknown. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether AE and CT treatments are effective in reducing SDS via downregulation of cortisol levels. The possible additive effects of combined AE+CT were also assessed. Eighty AD patients were randomly assigned to AE (n?=?20), CT (n?=?20), AE+CT (n?=?20), and standard therapy (no treatment, NT; n?=?20). Treatments were administered for 3 months, 5 days/week, 1 hour before sunset. Before and after treatments, salivary cortisol levels were sampled at 7, 11, 15, at sunset, and 20 (time of day). Blind assessment of behavioral disorders (neuropsychiatric inventory, NPI) and agitation (agitated behavior scale, ABS) were also performed. After interventions, cortisol levels were reduced in AE and AE+CT by ~26%. In the same groups, NPI and ABS decreased by ~50%. By contrast, cortisol and behavioral  disorders were similar to baseline in CT and NT. Changes in NPI and ABS were significantly correlated with the reduction in cortisol levels. AE or AE+CT effects on SDS and cortisol levels and the lack of effect of CT alone indicate the effectiveness of an exercise-based treatment on SDS, suggesting a possible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulation underpinning SDS.

      "[CLS] Proteinopathies represent a group of diseases characterized by the unregulated misfolding and aggregation of proteins. Accumulation of misfolded protein in the  central nervous system (CNS) is associated with neurodegenerative diseases, [MASK]  as the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (or prion diseases), Alzheimers disease, and the synucleinopathies (the most common of which is Parkinsons disease). Of these, the pathogenic mechanisms of prion diseases are particularly  striking where the transmissible, causative agent of disease is the prion, or proteinaceous infectious particle. Prions are composed almost exclusively of PrPSc ; a misfolded isoform of the normal cellular protein, PrPC , which is found accumulated in the CNS in disease. Today, mounting evidence suggests other aggregating proteins, [MASK] as amyloid-ß (Aß) and a-synuclein (a-syn), proteins associated with Alzheimers disease and synucleinopathies, respectively, share similar biophysical and biochemical properties with PrPSc that influences how they misfold, aggregate, and propagate in disease.

Unifying knowledge of folded proteins may also reveal common mechanisms associated with other features of disease that are less understood, [MASK] as neurotoxicity.

Several proteins are known to misfold and accumulate in the central nervous system causing a range of neurodegenerative diseases, [MASK] as Alzheimers, Parkinsons, and the prion diseases. Prions are transmissible misfolded conformers of the prion protein, PrP, which seed further generation of infectious proteins.

      "[CLS] Characteristic features of Alzheimers disease are memory loss, plaques resulting from abnormal processing of amyloid precursor [MASK] (APP), and presence of neurofibrillary tangles and dystrophic neurites containing hyperphosphorylated tau. Currently, it is not known what links these abnormalities together. Cytoplasmic FMR1 interacting [MASK] 2 (CYFIP2) has been suggested to regulate mRNA translation at synapses and this may include local synthesis of APP and alpha-calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II, a kinase that can phosphorylate tau. Further, CYFIP2 is part of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome [MASK]-family verprolin-homologous [MASK] complex, which has been implicated in actin polymerization at synapses, a process thought to be required for memory formation. Our previous studies on p25 dysregulation put forward the hypothesis that CYFIP2 expression is reduced in Alzheimers disease and that this contributes to memory impairment, abnormal APP processing and tau hyperphosphorylation. Here, we tested this hypothesis. First, in post-mortem tissue CYFIP2 expression was reduced by ~50% in severe Alzheimers hippocampus and superior temporal gyrus when normalized to expression of a neuronal or synaptic marker [MASK]. Interestingly, there was also a trend for decreased expression in mild Alzheimers disease hippocampus. Second, CYFIP2 expression was reduced in old but not in young Tg2576 mice, a model of familial Alzheimers disease. Finally, we tested the direct impact of reduced CYFIP2 expression in heterozygous null mutant mice. We found that in hippocampus this reduced expression causes an increase in APP and ß-site amyloid precursor [MASK] cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) [MASK], but not mRNA expression, and elevates production of amyloid-ß42 Reduced CYFIP2 expression also increases alpha-calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II [MASK] expression, and this is associated with hyperphosphorylation of tau at serine-214. The reduced expression also impairs spine maturity without affecting spine density in apical dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons. Furthermore, the reduced expression prevents retention  of spatial memory in the water maze. Taken together, our findings indicate that reduced CYFIP2 expression triggers a cascade of change towards Alzheimers disease, including amyloid production, tau hyperphosphorylation and memory loss.  We therefore suggest that CYFIP2 could be a potential hub for targeting treatment of the disease. [SEP]\t\tprotein\n",

We aimed to determine the effect of BDNF Val66Met on cognitive function, hippocampal function, tau and amyloid-ß in [MASK] autosomal dominant Alzheimers disease. We explored effects of apolipoprotein E (APOE) e4 on these relationships. The Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network conducted clinical, neuropsychological, genetic, biomarker and neuroimaging measures at baseline in 131 mutation non-carriers and  143 [MASK] autosomal dominant Alzheimers disease mutation carriers on average 12 years before clinical symptom onset. BDNF genotype data were obtained  for mutation carriers (95 Val66 homozygotes, 48 Met66 carriers).

We recently characterized transgenic mice carrying human CASP4, and observed that the mice manifested profound innate immune responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Since these inflammatory processes are important in the aetiology of AD, we have  now analysed the correlation of expression of caspase-4 in human brain with AD risk genes, and studied caspase-4 effects on AD-related phenotypes in APPswe/PS1deltaE9 (APP/PS1) mice. We observed that the expression of caspase-4 was strongly correlated with AD risk genes including TYROBP, TREM2, CR1, PSEN1, MS4A4A and MS4A6A in LOAD brains. Caspase-4 expression was upregulated in CASP4/APP/PS1 mice in a region-specific manner, including hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. In APP/PS1 mice, caspase-4 expression led to impairments in the reversal phase of a Barnes maze task and in hippocampal synaptic plasticity,  without affecting soluble or aggregated Aß levels. Caspase-4 was expressed predominantly in microglial cells, and in the presence of CASP4, more microglia were clustered around amyloid plaques. Furthermore, our data indicated that caspase-4 modulates microglial cells in a manner that increases proinflammatory processes. We propose that microglial caspase-4 expression contributes to the cognitive impairments in AD, and that further study of caspase-4 will enhance our understanding of AD pathogenesis and may lead to novel therapeutic targets in AD.

We used nondenaturing gel electrophoresis to test for  differences in the size of apoE complexes in human CSF samples of various APOE [MASK] and created profiles of each sample to compare the patterns of apoE distribution. For middle-aged adults with no dementia, APOE 2.3 individuals had significantly larger apoE complexes than APOE 3.3 subjects, who had significantly larger apoE complexes than APOE 3.4 and APOE 4.4 individuals. Similarly, in an independent cohort of older adults, CSF apoE complexes of APOE4-positive individuals were smaller than those of the APOE4-negative individuals. Compared to individuals with no dementia, those with the mildest stages of dementia had similar sized CSF apoE complexes.

DISCUSSION: The long gap between NFT accumulation and neuronal loss suggests that a second trigger may be necessary to induce neuronal death in AD. Imaging studies should determine [MASK] LC volumetry can replicate the stage-wise atrophy observed here and how these changes are specific to AD. LC volumetry may develop  into a screening biomarker for selecting high-yield candidates to undergo expensive and less accessible positron emission tomography scans and to monitor AD progression from presymptomatic stages.

      "[CLS] In tau proteins, [MASK] hexapeptides in [MASK] R2 and R3 repeats are known to initiate  tau fibril formation, which causes a class of neurodegenerative diseases called [MASK] taupathies.

      "[CLS] Alzheimers disease (AD), a major neurodegenerative disorder, is associated with  the enzymatic reaction of ß-secretase (BACE1) on the amyloid precursor protein (APP) for the generation of neurotoxic amyloid-ß (Aß). Therefore, Aß accumulation and oxidative stress-induced neuronal cell death are the pathogenic hallmarks of  AD. In this study, we tried to identify BACE1 inhibitors and neuroprotectants from natural products, in particular, from the Korean mushroom Polyozellus multiplex. Four p-terphenyls were identified from the ethanolic extract of P. multiplex; polyozellin (1), thelephoric acid (2), polyozellic acid (3), and kynapcin-12 (4). Compounds 1-4 effectively inhibited BACE1 activity with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 3.08, 3.50, 4.78, and 15.79 µM, respectively. Compounds 1-3 reduced the production of neurotoxic Aß1-42 production in APPswe-N2a cells in a concentration-dependent manner. When HT22 cells were stressed with 5 mM glutamate, compounds 2 and 3 significantly recovered cell viability. It was correlated with their inhibitory properties against glutamate-mediated Ca(2+) influx, intracellular reactive oxygen species [MASK] generation, lipid peroxidation, reduction in Bcl-2 and Bid levels, and enhanced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK).

Fluid biomarkers for these pathological brain alterations allow for early diagnosis in the preclinical stages of AD, and for objective prognostic assessments in clinical intervention trials. These biomarkers may also be helpful in the screening of CF. The present study reviewed the literature and identified systematic reviews of [MASK] studies and other authoritative reports. The selection criteria for potentially suitable fluid biomarkers included: i) Frequent use in studies of fluid-derived markers and ii) evidence of novel measurement techniques for fluid-derived markers. The present study focused on studies that assessed these biomarkers in AD, mild cognitive impairment and non-AD demented subjects. At present, widely used fluid  biomarkers include cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), total tau, phosphorylated tau and amyloid-ß levels. With the development of novel measurement techniques and improvements in understanding regarding the mechanisms underlying aging-related major neurocognitive disorders, numerous novel biomarkers associated with various aspects of AD neuropathology are being explored. These include specific measurements of Aß oligomer or monomer forms, tau proteins in the peripheral plasma and CSF, and novel markers of synaptic dysfunction, neuronal damage and apoptosis, neuronal activity alteration, neuroinflammation, blood brain barrier dysfunction, oxidative stress, metabolites, mitochondrial function and aberrant lipid metabolism. The proposed panels of fluid biomarkers may be useful in the early diagnosis of AD, prediction of the progression of AD from preclinical stages to the dementia stage, and the differentiation of AD from non-AD dementia. In combination with physical frailty, the present study surmised that these biomarkers may also be used as biomarkers for CF, thus contribute to discovering  causes and informing interventions for cognitive impairment in individuals with CF.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Transport across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) [MASK] an important mediator of beta-amyloid (Aß) accumulation in the brain and a contributing factor in the pathogenes[MASK] of Alzheimers d[MASK]ease (AD). One of the receptors responsible for the transport of Aß in the BBB [MASK] the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1). LRP1 [MASK] susceptible to proteolytic shedding at the cell surface, which prevents endocytic transport of ligands. Previously, we reported a strong inverse correlation between LRP1 shedding in the brain and Aß transit across the BBB. Several proteases contribute to the ectodomain shedding of LRP1 including the a-secretase, a desintegrin and metalloproteinase domain containing protein 10 (ADAM10). METHODS: The role of ADAM10 in the shedding of LRP1 and Aß BBB clearance was assessed through pharmacological inhibition of ADAM10 in an in vitro model of the BBB and through the use of ADAM10 endothelial specific knock-out mice. In addition, an acute treatment paradigm with an ADAM10 inhibitor was also tested in an AD mouse model to assess the effect of ADAM10 inhibition on LRP1 shedding and  Aßbrain accumulation. RESULTS: In the current studies, inhibition of ADAM10 reduced LRP1 shedding in brain endothelial cultures and increased Aß42 transit across an in vitro model of the BBB. Similarly, transgenic ADAM10 endothelial knockout mice d[MASK]played lower LRP1 shedding in the brain and significantly enhanced Aß clearance across the BBB compared to wild-type animals. Acute treatment with the ADAM10-selective inhibitor GI254023X in an AD mouse model substantially reduced brain LRP1 shedding and increased Aß40 levels in the plasma, indicating enhanced Aß transit  from the brain to the periphery. Furthermore, both soluble and insoluble Aß40 and Aß42 brain levels were decreased following GI254023X treatment, but these effects lacked stat[MASK]tical significance. CONCLUSIONS: These studies demonstrate a role for ADAM10 in the ectodomain shedding of LRP1 in the brain and the clearance of Aß across the BBB, which may provide a novel strategy for attenuating Aß accumulation in the AD brain.

      "[CLS] Alzheimers disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the most common form of dementia. However, biomarkers that require testing in the brain tissue pose a formidable practical barrier to AD diagnostic innovation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are responsible for control of gene expression at the posttranscriptional level and are essential for the function of neuronal networks and neuronal survival. miRNA expression can impact the regulation of APP (amyloid beta A4 precursor protein), PSEN1 (presenilin 1), PSEN2 (presenilin 2), and BACE1 (beta-secretase 1) genes in the brain that were previously implicated in AD pathophysiology. Little is known, however, on the extent to which peripheral tissue (e.g., whole blood) miRNA variation might offer clinical predictive value  for AD. Moreover, few studies have examined multiple peripheral miRNA expression  data at the same time. We report here, to the best of our knowledge, the first whole-blood-based and parallel study of seven miRNAs (hsa-miR-9-5p, hsa-miR-29a-3p, hsa-miR-106a-5p, hsa-miR-106b-5p, hsa-miR-107, hsa-miR-125a-3p, and hsa-miR-125b-5p) in relation to AD susceptibility. [MASK] these miRNAs are  situated \"upstream\" to the genes implicated in AD. We measured the whole-blood miRNA expression by a real-time polymerase chain reaction in a large study sample (n?=?281), comprising patients with AD (n?=?172) and healthy controls (n?=?109).  A reduction in whole-blood expression of hsa-miR-9-5p, hsa-miR-106a-5p, hsa-miR-106b-5p, and hsa-miR-107 was significantly associated with an increased risk of AD (p?<?0.05). [MASK] after receiver operating characteristics curve analyses, hsa-miR-106a-5p displayed, as a predictor variable, 93% specificity and 68% sensitivity.

In conclusion, these observations warrant replication in larger samples while making a contribution to translational research, precision medicine, and biomarker literatures, by expanding the current efforts for AD diagnostic innovation to the realm of epigenomic pathways such as  miRNA expression variation among patients.

      "[CLS] Episodic memory recall processes in Alzheimers disease (AD) and behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) can be similarly impaired, whereas recognition performance is more variable. A potential reason for this variability could be false-positive errors made on recognition trials and whether these errors are due to amnesia per se or a general over-endorsement of recognition items regardless of memory. The current study addressed this issue by analysing recognition performance on the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) in 39 bvFTD, 77 AD and 61 control participants from two centers (India, Australia), as  well as disinhibition assessed using the Hayling test. Whereas both AD and bvFTD  patients were comparably impaired on delayed recall, bvFTD patients showed intact recognition performance in terms of the number of correct hits. However, both patient groups endorsed significantly more false-positives than controls, and bvFTD and AD patients scored [MASK] poorly on a sensitivity index (correct hits-false-positives). Furthermore, measures of disinhibition were significantly  associated with false positives in both groups, with a stronger relationship with false-positives in bvFTD. Voxel-based morphometry analyses revealed similar neural correlates of false positive endorsement across bvFTD and AD, with both patient groups showing involvement of prefrontal and Papez circuitry regions, such as medial temporal and thalamic regions, and a DTI analysis detected an emerging but non-significant trend between false positives and decreased fornix integrity in bvFTD only. These findings suggest that false-positive errors on recognition tests relate to similar mechanisms in bvFTD and AD, reflecting deficits in episodic memory processes and disinhibition. These findings highlight that current memory tests are not sufficient to accurately distinguish between bvFTD and AD patients. [SEP]\t\tequally\n",

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Since its initial discovery, current understanding on the functional role of the Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products (RAGE) in physiology and in pathology has impressively grown, especially in consideration of its large ligand repertoire (AGEs, HMGB-1, ß amyloid, S100B/S100A12) and its potential involvement in the pathophysiology of several chronic human disorders.  Downstream RAGE engagement by its ligands, NF-?B signaling activation has been demonstrated in several cell phenotypes, including neurons and glia. Based on the observation that in Alzheimers Disease (AD) brain expression of RAGE and its ligands is upregulated and that RAGE/NF-?B axis activation can trigger an autoregulatory loop which further amplifies neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, this signaling pathway has been hypothesized to greatly contribute to AD pathophysiology. Herein we review the vast array of information  supporting a detrimental role of RAGE/NF-?B axis activation in AD brain and discuss those data in the context of recent findings obtained in our laboratory pointing to an unexpected effect elicited by this signaling pathway which may rather contribute to reparative mechanisms in AD, namely positive modulation of adult neurogenesis. Interestingly, the proneurogenic effect resulting from RAGE/NF-?B axis activation could be induced by molecules which are commonly considered as mediators of toxicity, like [MASK] oligomers and HMGB-1. CONCLUSION: Altogether, despite a large set of data suggesting that RAGE may represent an interesting target for the pharmacological treatment of AD, the complex functional roles of the receptor would require the use of molecules able  to counteract RAGE negative effects without altering the positive ones such as the promotion of adult neurogenesis.

BIN1 undergoes complex alternative splicing to generate multiple [MASK]s with diverse functions in multiple cellular processes including endocytosis and membrane remodeling. An increase in BIN1 expression in AD and an interaction between BIN1 and Tau have been reported. However, disparate descriptions of BIN1  expression and localization in the brain previously reported in the literature and the lack of clarity on brain BIN1 [MASK]s present formidable challenges to our understanding of how genetic variants in BIN1 increase the risk for AD. METHODS: In this study, we analyzed BIN1 mRNA and protein levels in human brain samples from individuals with or without AD. In addition, we characterized the BIN1 expression and [MASK] diversity in human and rodent tissue by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting using a panel of BIN1 antibodies. RESULTS: Here, we report on BIN1 [MASK] diversity in the human brain and document alterations in the levels of select BIN1 [MASK]s in individuals with AD. In addition, we report striking BIN1 localization to white matter tracts in rodent and the human brain, and document that the large majority of BIN1 is expressed in mature oligodendrocytes whereas neuronal BIN1 represents a minor fraction. This predominant non-neuronal BIN1 localization contrasts with the strict neuronal expression and presynaptic localization of the BIN1 paralog, Amphiphysin 1. We also observe upregulation of BIN1 at the onset of postnatal myelination in the brain and during differentiation of cultured oligodendrocytes. Finally, we document that the loss of BIN1 significantly correlates with the extent of demyelination in multiple sclerosis lesions. CONCLUSION: Our study provides new insights into the brain distribution and cellular expression of an important risk factor associated with late-onset AD. We propose that efforts to define how genetic variants in BIN1 elevate the risk for  AD would behoove to consider BIN1 function in the context of its main expression  in mature oligodendrocytes and the potential for a role of BIN1 in the membrane remodeling that accompanies the process of myelination.

      "[CLS] PURPOSE: Although a number of studies have focused on finding anatomical regions  in which iron concentrations are high, no study has been conducted to examine the overall variations in susceptibility maps of Alzheimers disease (AD). The objective of this study, therefore, was to differentiate AD from cognitive normal (CN) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using a texture analysis of quantitative susceptibility maps (QSMs). METHODS: The study was approved by the local institutional review board, and informed consent was obtained from all subjects. In each participant group-CN, MCI, and AD-18 elderly subjects were enrolled. A fully first-order flow-compensated [MASK] gradient-echo sequence was run to obtain axial magnitudes and phase images and to produce QSM data. Sagittal structural [MASK] T1-weighted ([MASK]T1W)  images were also obtained with the magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition of gradient-echo sequence to obtain brain tissue images. The first- and second-order texture parameters of the QSMs and [MASK]T1W images were obtained to evaluate group differences using a one-way analysis of covariance. RESULTS: For the first-order QSM analysis, mean, standard deviation, and covariance of signal intensity separated the subject groups (F = 5.191, p = 0.009). For the second-order analysis, angular second moment, contrast, and correlation separated the subject groups (F = 6.896, p = 0.002). Finally, a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis differentiated MCI from CN in white matter on the QSMs (z = 3.092, p = 0.0020). CONCLUSIONS: This was the first study to evaluate the textures of QSM in AD, which overcame the limitations of voxel-based analyses. The QSM texture analysis  successfully distinguished both AD and MCI from CN and outperformed the voxel-based analysis using [MASK]T1-weighed images in separating MCI from CN. The first-order textures were more efficient in differentiating MCI from CN than did  the second-order. [SEP]\t\t3D\n",

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Developing measures to detect preclinical Alzheimers Disease is vital, as prodromal stage interventions may prove more efficacious in altering the diseases trajectory. Gait changes may serve as a useful clinical heuristic that precedes cognitive decline. This study provides the first systematic investigation of gait [MASK] relationship with relevant demographic, physical, genetic (Apolipoprotein E genotype), and health risk factors in non-demented older adults during a cognitive-load dual task walking condition. METHODS: The GAITRite system provided objective measurement of gait [MASK] in APOE-e4 \"carriers\" (n = 75) and \"non-carriers\" (n = 224). Analyses examined stride length and step time gait [MASK] during simple  and dual-task (spelling five-letter words backwards) conditions in relation to demographic, physical, genetic, and health risk factors. RESULTS: Slower step time and shorter stride length associated with older age, greater health risk, and worse physical performance (ps < .05). Men and women differed in height, gait [MASK], health risk factors and global cognition (ps < .05). APOE-e4 associated with a higher likelihood of hypercholesterolemia and overall illness index scores (ps < .05). No genotype-sex interactions on gait were found. APOE-e4 was linked to shorter stride length and  greater dual-task related disturbances in stride length. CONCLUSIONS: Stride length has been linked to heightened fall risk, attention decrements and structural brain changes in older adults. Our results indicate that stride length is a useful behavioral marker of cognitive change that is associated with genetic risk for AD. Sex disparities in motor decline may be a function of health risk factors. [SEP]\t\tcharacteristics\n",

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: The effect of different educational indices on clinical diagnosis of  dementia requires more investigation. OBJECTIVE: We compared the differential influence of two educational indices (EIs): years of schooling and level of education (i.e., null/low literacy, can read and write, primary school, and secondary school) on global cognition, [MASK] performance, and the probability of having a dementia diagnosis. METHOD: A total of 3,816 participants were selected from the population-based study of older adults \"Neurological Disorders in Central Spain\" (NEDICES). The 37-item version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE-37) and the Pfeffers  questionnaire were applied to assess cognitive and [MASK] performance, respectively. The diagnosis of dementia was performed by expert neurologists according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria. Logistic regression models adjusted for potential confounders  were carried out to test the association between the two EIs and dementia diagnosis. RESULTS: Both EIs were significantly associated with cognitive and [MASK] scores, but individuals with null/low literacy performed significantly worse on MMSE-37 than literates when these groups were compared in terms of years of schooling. The two EIs were also related to an increased probability of dementia  diagnosis in logistic models, but the associations strength was stronger for level of education than for years of schooling. CONCLUSION: Literacy predicted cognitive performance over and above the years of  schooling. Lower education increases the probability of having a dementia diagnosis but the impact of different EIs is not uniform. [SEP]\t\tfunctional\n",

      "[CLS] Variants at 21 genetic loci have been associated with an increased risk for Alzheimers disease (AD). An important unresolved question is whether multiple genetic risk factors can be combined to increase the power to detect changes in neuroimaging biomarkers for AD. We acquired high-resolution structural images of  the [MASK] in 66 healthy, older human subjects. For 45 of these subjects, longitudinal 2-year follow-up data were also available. We calculated an additive AD genetic risk score for each participant and contrasted this with a weighted risk score (WRS) approach. Each score included APOE (apolipoprotein E), CLU (clusterin), PICALM (phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein), and family history of AD. Both unweighted risk score (URS) and WRS correlated strongly with the percentage change in thickness across the whole hippocampal complex (URS: r = -0.40; p = 0.003; WRS: r = -0.25, p = 0.048), driven by a strong relationship to entorhinal cortex thinning (URS: r = -0.35; p = 0.009; WRS: r = -0.35, p = 0.009). By contrast, at baseline the risk scores showed no relationship to thickness in any hippocampal complex subregion. These results provide compelling evidence that polygenic AD risk scores may be especially sensitive to structural change over time in regions affected early in AD, like the [MASK] and adjacent entorhinal cortex. This work also supports the paradigm of studying genetic risk for disease in healthy volunteers. Together, these findings will inform clinical trial design by supporting the idea that genetic prescreening in healthy control subjects can be useful to maximize the ability to detect an effect on a longitudinal neuroimaging endpoint, like hippocampal complex cortical thickness.

We calculated standardized mortality ratios (SMR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) by applying gender-, age- and calendar time-death rates to person-years at risk. RESULTS: Ulcerative colitis patients had overall mortality comparable to the general population (SMR 0.99, 95%CI 0.85-1.14), though being at increased risk of dying from Hodgkins disease (SMR 11.74, 95%CI 2.94-46.94), rectal cancer (SMR 3.69, 95%CI 1.66-8.22) and Alzheimers disease (2.40, 95%CI 1.00-5.76). Crohns disease patients had an increased overall mortality (SMR 1.79, 95%CI 1.39-2.27) and were at higher risk of dying from cancer (SMR 2.57, 95%CI 1.28-5.13) and non-cancer diseases of the respiratory system (SMR 2.51, 95%CI 1.05-6.04), brain  cancer (SMR 6.26, 95%CI 1.57-25.02) and non-cancer diseases of the genitourinary  system (SMR 4.38, 95%CI 1.10-17.52).

      "[CLS] Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) constitutes an important tool for the [MASK] diagnosis of Alzheimers Disease (AD), which, in turn, allows the application of  treatments that can be simpler and more likely to be effective. This paper explores the construction of classification methods based on deep learning architectures applied on brain regions defined by the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL). Gray Matter (GM) images from each brain area have been split into 3D patches according to the regions defined by the AAL atlas and these patches are used to train different deep belief networks. An ensemble of deep belief networks is then composed where the final prediction is determined by a voting scheme. Two deep learning based structures and four different voting schemes are  implemented and compared, giving as a result a potent classification architecture where discriminative features are computed in an unsupervised fashion. The resulting method has been evaluated using a large dataset from the Alzheimers disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Classification results assessed by cross-validation prove that the proposed method is not only valid for differentiate between controls (NC) and AD images, but it also provides good performances when tested for the more challenging case of classifying Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) Subjects. In particular, the classification architecture provides accuracy values up to 0.90 and AUC of 0.95 for NC/AD classification, 0.84 and AUC of 0.91 for stable MCI/AD classification and 0.83 and AUC of 0.95 for NC/MCI converters classification.

The HupA biosynthetic pathway is thought to be initiated [MASK] the decarboxylation of lysine to form cadaverine, which is then converted to 5-aminopentanal [MASK] copper amine oxidase (CAO). In this study, we cloned and expressed an SsCAO gene from a HupA-producing endophytic fungus, Shiraia sp. Slf14. Analysis of the deduced protein amino acid sequence showed that it contained the Asp catalytic base, conserved motif Asn-Tyr-Asp/Glu, and three copper-binding histidines. The cDNA of SsCAO was amplified and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3), from which a 76 kDa protein was obtained. The activity of this enzyme was tested, which provided more information about the SsCAO gene in the endophytic fungus. Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS)  revealed that this SsCAO could accept cadaverine as a substrate to produce 5-aminopentanal, the precursor of HupA. Phylogenetic tree analysis indicated that the SsCAO from Shiraia sp. Slf14 was closely related to Stemphylium lycopersici CAO. This is the first report on the cloning and expression of a CAO gene from HupA-producing endophytic fungi. Functional characterization of this enzyme provides new insights into the biosynthesis of the HupA an anti-Alzheimers drug. [SEP]\t\tby\n",

      "[CLS] The spread of tau pathology correlates with cognitive decline in Alzheimers disease. In vitro, tau antibodies can block cell-to-cell tau spreading. Although  mechanisms of anti-tau function in vivo are unknown, effector function might promote microglia-mediated clearance. In this study, we investigated whether antibody effector function is required for targeting tau. We compared efficacy in vivo and in vitro of two versions of the same tau antibody, with and without effector function, measuring tau pathology, neuron health, and microglial function. Both antibodies reduced accumulation of tau pathology in Tau-P301L transgenic mice and protected cultured neurons against extracellular [MASK]  toxicity. Only the full-effector antibody enhanced tau uptake in cultured microglia, which promoted release of proinflammatory cytokines. In neuron-microglia co-cultures, only effectorless anti-tau protected neurons, suggesting full-effector tau antibodies can induce indirect toxicity via microglia. We conclude that effector function is not required for efficacy, and effectorless tau antibodies may represent a safer approach to targeting tau. [SEP]\t\ttau-induced\n",

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Dementia is very common in Down syndrome (trisomy 21) adults. Statins may slow brain amyloid ß (Aß, coded on chromosome 21) deposition and, therefore,  delay Alzheimer disease onset. One prospective cohort study with Down syndrome adults found participants on statins had reduced risk of incident dementia, but there are no randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on this issue. Evidence is sparse on the best instruments to detect longitudinal cognitive decline in older  Down syndrome adults. METHODS: TOP-COG was a feasibility/pilot, double-blind RCT of 12 months simvastatin 40 mg versus placebo for the primary prevention of dementia in Alzheimer disease in Down syndrome adults aged 50 years or older. Group allocation was stratified by age, apolipoprotein E (APOE) e4 allele status, and cholesterol level. Recruitment was from multiple general community sources over 12 months. Adults with dementia, or simvastatin contraindications, were excluded. Main outcomes were recruitment and retention rates. Cognitive decline was measured with a battery of tests; secondary measures were adaptive behaviour skills, general health, and quality of life. [MASK] were conducted pre randomisation and at 12 months post randomisation. Blood Aß40/Aß42 levels were investigated as a putative biomarker. Results were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. A qualitative sub-study was conducted and analysed using the Framework Approach to determine recruitment motivators/barriers, and participation experience. RESULTS: We identified 181 (78 %) of the likely eligible Down syndrome population, and recruited 21 (11.6 %), from an area with a general population size of 3,135,974. Recruitment was highly labour-intensive. Thirteen (62 %) participants completed the full year. Results favoured the simvastatin group. The most appropriate cognitive instrument (regarding ease of completion and detecting change over time) was the Memory for Objects test from the Neuropsychological Assessment of Dementia in Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities battery. Cognitive testing appeared more sensitive than proxy-rated adaptive behaviour, quality of life, or general health scores. Aß40 levels changed less for the simvastatin group (not statistically significant). People mostly declined to participate because of not wanting to take medication, and not knowing if they would receive simvastatin or placebo. Participants reported enjoying taking part. CONCLUSION: A full-scale RCT is feasible. It will need 37 % UK population coverage to recruit the required 160 participants. Information/education about the importance of RCT participation is needed for this population. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN67338640 . [SEP]\t\tAssessments\n",

      "[CLS] Alzheimers disease (AD) is histopathologically characterized by neurodegeneration, the formation of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles and extracellular Aß deposits that derive from proteolytic processing of the amyloid  precursor protein (APP). As rodents do not normally develop Aß pathology, various transgenic animal models of AD were designed to overexpress human APP with mutations favouring its amyloidogenic processing. However, these mouse models display tremendous differences in the spatial and temporal appearance of Aß deposits, synaptic dysfunction, neurodegeneration and the manifestation of learning deficits which may be caused by age-related and brain region-specific differences in APP transgene levels. Consequentially, a comparative temporal and  regional analysis of the pathological [MASK] of Aß in mouse brains is difficult  complicating the validation of therapeutic AD treatment strategies in different mouse models. To date, no antibodies are available that properly discriminate endogenous rodent and transgenic human APP in brains of APP-transgenic animals.

We observed remarkable differences in expression levels and brain region-specific expression of human APP among the investigated transgenic mouse lines. This may explain the differences between APP-transgenic models mentioned above.

Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining  and a western blot analysis were used to test the major proteins in the insulin signal transduction pathway. After the administration of curcumin for 6 months, the results showed that the expression of an insulin receptor (InR) and insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 decreased in the hippocampal CA1 area of the APPswe/PS1dE9 double transgenic mice, while the expression of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K), phosphorylated PI3K (p-PI3K), serine-threonine kinase (AKT) and phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) increased.

      "[CLS] Aberrant production, clearance and deposition of amyloid-ß protein (Aß) in the human brain have been implicated in the aetiology of Alzheimer disease (AD). ?-Secretase is the enzyme responsible for generating various Aß species, such as  Aß40 and toxic Aß42. Recently, genome-wide association studies in late-onset AD [MASK] have identified the endocytosis-related phosphatidylinositol-binding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM) gene as a genetic risk factor for AD. We previously found that the loss of expression of CALM protein encoded by PICALM affects the ratio of production of Aß42, through the regulation of the clathrin-mediated endocytosis of ?-secretase. Here, we show that the binding capacity of the assembly protein 180 N-terminal homology (ANTH) domain of CALM to phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate, as well as to nicastrin, is critical to the modulation of the internalization of ?-secretase and to the Aß42 production ratio.

CONCLUSION: Findings of the study provide a first foundation for future research  on the meaning and consequences of labeling in legal cases involving persons with AD. They suggest that increasing judges [MASK] about AD and reforming the existing status-based legal capacity legislation might benefit by limiting the  legal weight given today to the medical diagnosis.

      "[CLS] Decay of the temporoparietal cortex is associated with prodromal Alzheimers disease (AD). Additionally, shrinkage of the temporoparietal cerebral area has been connected with an increase in a3/a2 electroencephalogram (EEG) power ratio in prodromal AD. Furthermore, a lower regional blood perfusion has been exhibited in patients with a higher a3/a2 proportion when contrasted with low a3/a2 proportion. Furthermore, a lower regional blood perfusion and [MASK] hippocampal volume has been exhibited in patients with higher a3/a2 when contrasted with lower a3/a2 EEG power ratio. Neuropsychological evaluation, EEG recording, and magnetic resonance imaging were conducted in 74 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Estimation of cortical thickness and a3/a2 frequency power ratio was conducted for each patient. A subgroup of 27 patients also underwent single-photon emission computed tomography evaluation. In view of a3/a2 power ratio, the patients were divided into three groups. The connections among cortical decay, cerebral perfusion, and memory loss were evaluated by Pearsons r coefficient. Results demonstrated that higher a3/a2 frequency power ratio group was identified with brain shrinkage and cutdown perfusion inside the temporoparietal projections. In addition, decay and cutdown perfusion rate were connected with memory shortfalls in patients with MCI. MCI subgroup with higher a3/a2 EEG power ratio are at a greater risk to develop AD dementia.

      "[CLS] The presence of ß-amyloid (Aß) containing plaques in the brain is a hallmark of Alzheimers disease (AD) and serves as a biomarker for confirmation of diagnosis  postmortem. Early diagnosis is of great importance for optimal treatment and for  monitoring disease progression in the brain. Highly specific and sensitive biomarkers are thus greatly needed to assess therapeutic efficacy, not only clinically, but also in terms of clearance of histopathological lesions and decelerated neurodegeneration. The objective of the present study was to give more insight into the binding of curcumin analogues, curcuminoids, to Aß containing plaques in postmortem tissue from AD patients. In vitro autoradiography was utilized to [MASK] affinity and displacement of the curcuminoids; curcumin, demethoxycurcumin (DMC), bisdemethoxycurcumin (BDMC) and  dimethoxycurcumin (DIMC). We found that BDMC had the highest affinity for Aß containing plaques in cortical AD brain tissue in comparison to other curcuminoids. Subsequently, [(3)H]BDMC showed significantly higher specific binding in cortical AD brain tissue compared to control subjects. These findings  suggest that curcumin analogues, especially BDMC, may serve as a potential radioligands for Aß plaque neuroimaging. [SEP]\t\texplore\n",

      "[CLS] Currently, several immunotherapies and BACE (Beta Site APP Cleaving Enzyme) inhibitor approaches are being tested in the clinic for the treatment of Alzheimers disease. A crucial mechanism-related safety concern is the exacerbation of microhemorrhages, which are already present in the majority of Alzheimer patients. To investigate potential safety liabilities of long-term BACE inhibitor therapy, we used aged amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice (APP23), which robustly develop cerebral amyloid angiopathy. T2*-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a translational method applicable in preclinical and clinical studies, was used for the detection of microhemorrhages  throughout the entire brain, with subsequent histological validation. Three-dimensional reconstruction based on in vivo MRI and serial Perls stained sections demonstrated a one-to-one matching of the lesions thus allowing for their histopathological [MASK] MRI detected small Perls positive areas with a high spatial resolution. Our data demonstrate that volumetric assessment by noninvasive MRI is well suited to monitor cerebral microhemorrhages in vivo. Furthermore, 3 months treatment of aged APP23 with the potent BACE-inhibitor NB-360 did not exacerbate microhemorrhages in contrast to Aß-antibody ß1. These results substantiate the safe use of BACE inhibitors regarding microhemorrhages in long-term clinical studies for the treatment of Alzheimers disease. [SEP]\t\tcharacterization.\n",

      "[CLS] Resting-state functional connectivity (FC) is altered in Alzheimers disease (AD) but its predictive value for episodic memory impairment is debated. Here, we aimed to assess whether resting-state FC in core brain regions activated during memory-task functional magnetic resonance imaging is altered and predictive of memory performance in AD and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). Twenty-three elderly cognitively healthy controls (HC), 76 aMCI subjects, and 19  AD dementia patients were included. We computed resting-state FC between 18 meta-analytically determined peak coordinates of brain activation during successful memory retrieval. Higher FC between the parahippocampus, parietal cortex, and the middle frontal gyrus was observed in both AD and mild cognitive impairment compared to HC (false-discovery rate-corrected p < 0.05). The increase in FC between the parahippocampus and middle frontal gyrus was associated with reduced episodic memory in aMCI, independent of amyloid-beta positron emission [MASK] binding and apolipoprotein E e4-carrier status. In conclusion, increased parahippocampal-prefrontal FC is predictive of impaired episodic memory in aMCI and may reflect a dysfunctional change within the episodic memory-related neural network.

      "[CLS] The elevated level of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Tau and phosphorylated Tau181 (p-Tau181) [MASK] are well established hallmarks of Alzheimers disease (AD). Elevated level of p-Tau181 can differentiate AD from other neurodegenerative disease. However, the expression level of these [MASK] in serum of AD patient is not well set up. This study sought to evaluate the level of Tau and p-Tau181 in serum of AD, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients for an alternative approach to establish protein-based markers by convenient way. Blood samples were collected from 39 AD patients, 37 MCI patients and 37 elderly individuals as controls. The levels of Tau and p-Tau181 in the serum of the different groups were measured by label free real time Surface Plasmon Resonance technology by using specific antibodies, and were further confirmed by the conventional western blot method. An appropriate statistical analysis, including Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC), was performed. The concentrations of serum Tau and p-Tau181 were significantly higher (p<0.00001) in AD (Tau; 47.49±9.00ng/µL, p-Tau181; 0.161±0.04 ng/µL) compared to MCI (Tau; 39.26±7.78 ng/µL, p-Tau181; 0.135±0.02 ng/µL) and were further higher compared to elderly controls (Tau; 34.92±6.58 ng/µL, p-Tau181; 0.122±0.01 ng/ µL). A significant (p<0.0001) downhill correlation was found between Tau as well as p-Tau181 levels with HMSE and MoCA score. This study for the first time reports the concentration of Tau and p-Tau181 in serum of AD and MCI patients. The cutoff values of Tau and p-Tau181 of AD and MCI patients with sensitivity and specificity reveal that serum level of these [MASK] can be used as a predictive marker for AD and MCI.

      "[CLS] Induction of neuroprotective heat-shock proteins via pharmacological Hsp90 inhibitors is currently being investigated as a potential treatment for neurodegenerative diseases. Two major hurdles for therapeutic use of Hsp90 inhibitors are systemic toxicity and limited central nervous system permeability. We demonstrate here that chronic treatment with a proprietary Hsp90 inhibitor compound ([MASK]) not only elicits a heat-shock-like response but also offers synaptic protection in symptomatic Tg2576 mice, a model of Alzheimers disease, without noticeable systemic toxicity. Despite a short half-life of [MASK] in mouse brain, a single intraperitoneal injection induces rapid and long-lasting (>3 days) nuclear activation of the heat-shock factor, HSF1. Mechanistic study indicates that the remedial effects of [MASK] depend upon HSF1 activation and the subsequent HSF1-mediated transcriptional events on synaptic genes. Taken together, this work reveals a novel role of HSF1 in synaptic function and memory, which likely occurs through modulation of the synaptic transcriptome. [SEP]\t\tOS47720\n",

      "[CLS] Rates of Alzheimers disease (AD) are rising worldwide. The most important risk factors seem to be linked to diet. For example, [MASK] Japan made the nutrition transition from the traditional Japanese diet to the Western diet, AD rates rose  from 1% in 1985 to 7% in 2008. Foods protective against AD include fruits, vegetables, grains, low-fat dairy products, legumes, and fish, whereas risk factors include meat, sweets, and high-fat dairy products. The evidence comes from ecological and observational studies as well as investigations of the mechanisms whereby dietary factors affect risk. The mechanisms linking dietary risk factors to AD are fairly well known and include increased oxidative stress from metal ions such as copper as well as from advanced glycation end products associated with high-temperature cooking, increased homocysteine concentrations,  and cholesterol and its effects on amyloid beta, insulin resistance, and obesity. Lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations also are associated with increased risk  of AD. In addition to reviewing the journal literature, a new ecological study was conducted using AD prevalence from 10 countries (Brazil, Chile, Cuba, Egypt,  India, Mongolia, Nigeria, Republic of Korea, Sri Lanka, and the United States) along with dietary supply data 5, 10, and 15 years before the prevalence data. Dietary supply of meat or animal products less milk 5 years before AD prevalence  had the highest correlations with AD prevalence in this study. Thus, reducing meat consumption could significantly reduce the risk of AD as well as of several  cancers, diabetes mellitus type 2, stroke, and, likely, chronic kidney disease.TEACHING POINTS: • Single-country ecological data can be used to find links between diet and AD because the national diet changes, such as during the nutrition transition to a Western diet. • Multicountry ecological studies can be  used to find links between dietary factors and risk of AD. • Prospective observational studies are useful in linking dietary components and patterns to risk of AD. • The most important dietary link to AD appears to be meat consumption, with eggs and high-fat dairy also contributing. • Diets high in grains, fruits, vegetables, and fish are associated with reduced risk of AD, but  these factors cannot counter the effects of meat, eggs, and high-fat dairy. • Higher vitamin D status is associated with reduced risk of AD.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Identification of [MASK] for the Alzheimers disease (AD) is a challenge and a very difficult task both for medical research and data analysis. METHODS: We applied a novel clustering tool with the goal to identify subpopulations of the AD patients that are homogeneous in respect of available clinical as well as in respect of biological descriptors. RESULTS: The main result is identification of three clusters of patients with significant problems with dementia. The evaluation of properties of these clusters demonstrates that brain atrophy is the main driving force of dementia. The unexpected result is that the largest subpopulation that has very significant problems with dementia has besides mild signs of brain atrophy also large ventricular, intracerebral and whole brain volumes. Due to the fact that ventricular enlargement may be a consequence of brain injuries and that a large majority of patients in this subpopulation are males, a potential hypothesis is that such medical status is a consequence of a combination of previous traumatic  events and degenerative processes. CONCLUSIONS: The results may have substantial consequences for medical research and clinical trial design. The clustering methodology used in this study may be interesting also for other medical and biological domains. [SEP]\t\tbiomarkers\n",

      "[CLS] INTRODUCTION: This study combined data across four independent cohorts to examine the positive and negative predictive values of an Alzheimers disease (AD) blood  test if implemented in primary care. METHODS: Blood samples from 1329 subjects from multiple independent, multiethnic, community-based, and [MASK] cohorts were analyzed. A \"locked-down\" referent group of 1128 samples was generated with 201 samples randomly selected for validation purposes. Random forest analyses were used to create the AD blood screen. Positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive values were calculated. RESULTS: In detecting AD, PPV was 0.81, and NPV was 0.95 while using the full AD  blood test. When detecting mild cognitive impairment, PPV and NPV were 0.74 and 0.93, respectively. Preliminary analyses were conducted to detect any \"neurodegenerative disease\". The full 21-protein AD blood test yielded a PPV of 0.85 and NPV of 0.94.

      "[CLS] Reelin is a large secreted glycoprotein that is essential for correct neuronal positioning during neurodevelopment and is important for synaptic plasticity in the mature brain. Moreover, Reelin is expressed in many extraneuronal tissues; yet the roles of peripheral Reelin are largely unknown. In the brain, many of Reelins functions are mediated by a molecular signaling cascade that involves two lipoprotein receptors, apolipoprotein E receptor-2 [MASK] and very low density-lipoprotein receptor (Vldlr), the neuronal phosphoprotein Disabled-1 (Dab1), and members of the Src family of protein tyrosine kinases as crucial elements. This core signaling pathway in turn modulates the activity of adaptor proteins and downstream protein kinase cascades, many of which target the neuronal cytoskeleton. However, additional Reelin-binding receptors have been postulated or described, either as coreceptors that are essential for the activation of the \"canonical\" Reelin signaling cascade involving Apoer2/Vldlr and Dab1, or as receptors that activate alternative or additional signaling pathways. Here we will give an overview of canonical and alternative Reelin signaling pathways, molecular mechanisms involved, and their potential physiological roles  in the context of different biological settings.

      "[CLS] Chronic neuroinflammation is thought to potentiate medial temporal lobe (MTL) atrophy and memory decline in Alzheimers disease (AD). It has become increasingly important to find novel immunological biomarkers of neuroinflammation or other processes that can track AD development and progression. Our study explored which pro- or anti-inflammatory cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers best [MASK] AD neuropathology over 24months. Using Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data (N=285), CSF inflammatory biomarkers from mass spectrometry and multiplex panels were screened using stepwise regression, followed up with 50%/50% model retests for validation. Neuronal Pentraxin 2 (NPTX2) and Chitinase-3-like-protein-1 (C3LP1), biomarkers of glutamatergic synaptic plasticity and microglial activation respectively, were the only consistently significant biomarkers selected. Once these biomarkers were selected, linear mixed models were used to analyze their baseline and longitudinal associations with bilateral MTL volume, memory decline, global cognition, and established AD biomarkers including CSF amyloid and tau. Higher baseline NPTX2 levels corresponded to less MTL atrophy [R2=0.287, p<0.001] and substantially less memory decline [R2=0.560, p<0.001] by month 24. Conversely, higher C3LP1 modestly [MASK] more MTL atrophy [R2=0.083, p<0.001], yet did not significantly track memory decline over time. In conclusion, NPTX2 is a novel pro-inflammatory cytokine that predicts AD-related outcomes better than any immunological biomarker to date, substantially accounting for brain atrophy and especially memory decline. C3LP1 as the microglial biomarker, by contrast, performed modestly and did not predict longitudinal memory decline. This research may advance the current understanding of AD etiopathogenesis, while expanding early diagnostic techniques through the use of novel pro-inflammatory biomarkers, such as NPTX2. Future studies should also see if NPTX2 causally affects MTL morphometry and memory performance. [SEP]\t\tpredicted\n",

In this study we have investigated the effect and the underlying mechanism of miR-328a on the cognitive function in PTZ-kindled rats. 48 SD male rats were divided into 4 groups as follows: a PTZ kindled group, a miR-328a antagomir group, an antagomir-control group, and a sham group (n=12 for each). All rats except those from the sham group were treated with PTZ 14 times at intervals of 48h to establish the temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) models, and miR-328a antagomir was given to the antagomir group as a treatment by lateral-ventricle injection the day after the first injection of PTZ. Morris water maze (MWM) test was performed to assay their learning and memory abilities. The down-regulation of miR-328a in the PTZ group was confirmed using RT-qPCR and  the expression of miR-328a was diminished after antagomir treatment (P<0.05). In  the probe test of water [MASK] the time and distance of the PTZ group were both shorter than those of the sham group (P<0.05), and those of the antagomir-control group were both longer than those of the antagomir group (P<0.05). In addition, we found that with the down-regulation of miR-328a, the levels of Beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE), which is a bioinformatics-predicted target of miR-328a, were up-regulated. These findings suggest that miR-328a may play a role in memory dysfunction in PTZ-kindled rats by regulating the BACE levels and this  links the PTZ model with Alzheimers disease. [SEP]\t\tmaze,\n",

We evaluated individuals with Huntingtons disease (HD), individuals with Alzheimers disease (AD), healthy middle-aged adults, and healthy older adults who were administered the CVLT-II. Yes/no recognition memory indices were  generated, including raw nonparametric TRD scores (as used in CVLT-I) and raw and standardized parametric TRD scores (as used in CVLT-II), as well as false positive ([MASK]) rates. Overall, the patient groups had significantly lower TRD scores than their comparison groups. The application of nonparametric and parametric formulas resulted in comparable effect sizes for all group comparisons on raw TRD scores.

These needs and characterizing factors may influence the applicability, and ultimately the acceptance, [MASK] assistive technologies developed to support the independence [MASK] people with dementia. Accordingly, predicting the needs [MASK] users before developing the technologies may increase the applicability and acceptance [MASK] assistive technologies. Current methods [MASK] prediction rely on the difficult collection [MASK] subjective, potentially invasive information. We propose a method [MASK] prediction that uses objective, unobtrusive, easy to collect information to help inform the development [MASK] assistive technologies. METHODS: We develop a set [MASK] models that can predict the level [MASK] independence [MASK] people with dementia during 20 activities [MASK] daily living using simple, objective information. Using data collected from a Canadian survey conducted with caregivers [MASK] people with dementia, we create an ordered logistic regression model for each [MASK] the twenty daily tasks in the Bristol ADL scale. RESULTS: Data collected from 430 Canadian caregivers [MASK] people with dementia were analyzed to reveal: most care recipients were mothers or husbands, married, living in private housing with their caregivers, English-speaking, Canadian born, clinically diagnosed with dementia 1 to 6 years prior to the study, and were dependent on their caregiver. Next, we developed models that use 13 factors to predict a person with dementias ability to complete the 20 Bristol activities [MASK] daily living independently. The 13 factors include caregiver relation, age, marital status, place [MASK] residence, language, housing type, proximity to caregiver, service use, informal primary caregiver, diagnosis [MASK] Alzheimers disease or dementia, time since diagnosis, and level [MASK] dependence on caregiver.  The resulting models predicted the aggregate level [MASK] independence correctly for  88 [MASK] 100 total responses categories, marginally for nine, and incorrectly for three.

      "[CLS] Neprilysin (NEP) is an endogenous protease that degrades a wide range of peptides including amyloid beta (Aß), the main pathological component of Alzheimers disease (AD). We have [MASK] NEP as a potential therapeutic for AD but found  in pre-clinical safety testing that this variant increased prothrombin time (PT)  and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT). The objective of the current study was to investigate the effect of wild type NEP and the [MASK] variant on coagulation and define the mechanism by which this effect is mediated. PT and  APTT were measured in cynomolgus monkeys and rats dosed with a human serum albumin fusion with an [MASK] variant of NEP (HSA-NEPv) as well as in control plasma spiked with wild type or variant enzyme. The coagulation factor targeted by NEP was determined using in vitro prothrombinase, calibrated automated thrombogram (CAT) and fibrin formation assays as well as N-terminal sequencing of fibrinogen treated with the enzyme. We demonstrate that HSA-NEP wild type and HSA-NEPv unexpectedly impaired coagulation, increasing PT and APTT in plasma samples and abolishing fibrin formation from fibrinogen. This effect was mediated through cleavage of the N-termini of the Aa- and Bß-chains of fibrinogen thereby  significantly impairing initiation of fibrin formation by thrombin. Fibrinogen has therefore been identified for the first time as a substrate for NEP wild type suggesting that the enzyme may have a role in regulating fibrin formation. Reductions in NEP levels observed in AD and cerebral amyloid angiopathy may contribute to neurovascular degeneration observed in these conditions. [SEP]\t\tengineered\n",

Accordingly, a large number of studies have demonstrated [MASK] an increase in LH levels is positively correlated with neuropathological, behavioral, and cognitive changes in AD.

The a7-nAChR is involved in interactions between the cholinergic and glutamatergic systems. In the present study, we investigated the  potential role of a7-nAChRs in the pro-cognitive effects of this drug combination. To this aim, cognitive performance in rats was assessed using the attentional set shifting task [MASK] and novel object recognition task (NORT). Co-administration of inactive doses of memantine with galantamine facilitated the rats set-shifting performance and reversed delay-induced deficits in object recognition. These effects were blocked by the a7-nAChR antagonist methyllycaconitine, suggesting that the observed cognitive enhancement is a7-nAChR dependent. Moreover, combined administration of memantine with inactive  doses of selective a7-nAChRs PAMs, CCMI and PNU-120596, also improved ASST and NORT performance in a methyllycaconitine-dependent manner.

The highest sensitivity and specificity in discriminating between the patients with MCI vs. early [MASK] was achieved with the volumetric measurement of the corpus callosum - the values were 73% and 71%, respectively, and the correct classification rate was 72%. The highest sensitivity and specificity in discriminating between HC and the patients with early [MASK] was achieved with the volumetric measurement of the entorhinal cortex - the values were 94% and 100%, respectively, and the correct classification rate was 97%. The highest sensitivity and specificity in discriminating between HC and the patients with MCI was achieved with the volumetric measurement of the temporal lobe cortex - the values were 90% and 93%, respectively, and the correct classification rate was 92%. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic value varied depending on the measurement technique.  The volumetric measurement of the atrophy proved to be the best imaging biomarker, which allowed the distinction between the groups of patients. The volumetric assessment of the corpus callosum proved to be a useful tool in discriminating between the patients with MCI vs. early [MASK]. [SEP]\t\tAD\n",

      "[CLS] Autophagy is a highly coordinated process that is controlled at several levels including transcriptional regulation. Here, we identify the transcription factor  NFE2L2/NRF2 (nuclear factor, erythroid 2 like 2) as a regulator of autophagy gene expression and its relevance in a mouse model of Alzheimer disease (AD) that reproduces impaired APP (amyloid ß precursor protein) and human (Hs)MAPT/TAU processing, clearance and aggregation. We screened the chromatin immunoprecipitation database ENCODE for 2 proteins, MAFK and BACH1, that bind the NFE2L2-regulated enhancer antioxidant response element (ARE). Using a script generated from the JASPARs consensus ARE sequence, we identified 27 putative AREs in 16 autophagy-related genes. Twelve of these sequences were validated as NFE2L2 regulated AREs in 9 autophagy genes by additional ChIP assays and quantitative RT-PCR on human and mouse cells after NFE2L2 activation with sulforaphane. Mouse embryo fibroblasts of nfe2l2-knockout mice exhibited reduced  expression of autophagy genes, which was rescued by an NFE2L2 expressing lentivirus, and impaired autophagy flux when exposed to hydrogen peroxide. NFE2L2-deficient mice co-expressing HsAPPV717I and HsMAPTP301L, exhibited more intracellular [MASK] of these proteins and reduced neuronal levels of SQSTM1/p62, CALCOCO2/NDP52, ULK1, ATG5 and GABARAPL1. Also, colocalization of HsAPPV717I and HsMAPTP301L with the NFE2L2-regulated autophagy marker SQSTM1/p62  was reduced in the absence of NFE2L2. In AD patients, neurons expressing high levels of APP or MAPT also expressed SQSTM1/p62 and nuclear NFE2L2, suggesting their attempt to degrade intraneuronal [MASK] through autophagy.

The 20 to 25 nucleotide (nt) tiny regulators, known as micro ribonucleic acids (miRNAs), have been found to play important roles in the etiology and pathogenesis of various biological processes. The purpose of the current study was to identify the aberrant expression of microRNAs in the hippocampus of an AD mouse model and to investigate its potential role during the progression of AD. The results from microarray analysis showed that several miRNAs were deregulated in the hippocampus tissue of SAMP8 mice compared to SAMR1 mice. Among the deregulated miRNAs, a significant decrease in miR-181c was validated by quantitative real-time PCR. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that miR-181c might be involved in the regulation of axon guidance, MAPK signaling, dorso-ventral axis formation and [MASK] depression. Moreover, the results of a luciferase activity assay, western blot analysis and immunofluorescent staining showed that over-expression  of miR-181c targets the 3-untranslated region (3-UTR) of collapsin response mediator protein 2 (crmp2) through its binding sites and down-regulates crmp2 protein abundance at the post-transcriptional level. Taken together, these findings suggested that crmp2 is a target of miR-181c and that the abnormally low expression of miR-181c in the hippocampus of SAMP8 mice could lead to an increase of the crmp2 protein level in AD mice, which might potentially play a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimers disease.

Neuroimaging studies may provide insight into this relation. OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypotheses that OSA and habitual short sleep duration, measured at ages 54-73 years, would be associated with adverse brain morphology at ages 67-89 years. METHODS: Included in this analysis are 312 ARIC study participants who underwent  in-home overnight polysomnography in 1996-1998 and brain MRI scans about 15 years later (2012-2013). Sleep apnea was quantified by the apnea-hypopnea index and categorized as moderate/severe (=15.0 events/hour), mild (5.0-14.9 events/hour),  or normal (<5.0 events/hour). Habitual sleep duration was categorized, in hours,  as <7, 7 to <8, =8. MRI outcomes included number of infarcts (total, subcortical, and cortical) and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) and Alzheimers disease signature region volumes. Multivariable adjusted logistic and linear regression models were used. All models incorporated inverse probability weighting, to adjust for potential selection bias. RESULTS: At the time of the sleep study participants were 61.7 (SD: 5.0) years old and 54% female; 19% had moderate/severe sleep apnea. MRI imaging took place 14.8 (SD: 1.0) years later, when participants were 76.5 (SD: 5.2) years old. In multivariable models which accounted for body mass index, neither OSA nor abnormal sleep duration were statistically significantly associated with odds of  cerebral infarcts, WMH brain volumes or regional brain volumes. CONCLUSIONS: In this community-based sample, mid-life OSA and habitually short sleep duration were not associated with later-life cerebral markers of vascular dementia and Alzheimers disease. However, selection bias may have influenced our results and the modest sample size led to relatively imprecise associations. [SEP]\t\thas\n",

METHODS AND RESULTS: 5XFAD mice, a useful mouse model of AD, and control wild-type mice were fed (1) high-fat diet or (2) control diet for 10 weeks. The effects on cerebral AD pathology, cognitive function, and [MASK] parameters were compared between each group of mice. High-fat diet significantly enhanced cerebrovascular ß-amyloid (Aß) deposition (P<0.05) and impaired cognitive function (P<0.05) in 5XFAD mice, but not in wild-type mice. High-fat diet enhanced hippocampal oxidative stress (P<0.05) and NADPH oxidase subunits, gp91(phox) (P<0.01) and p22(phox) (P<0.01) in 5XFAD mice, but not in wild-type mice. Furthermore, high-fat diet reduced cerebral occludin (P<0.05) in 5XFAD mice, but not in wild-type mice. Thus, 5XFAD mice exhibited greater susceptibility to high-fat diet than wild-type mice regarding cerebrovascular injury and cognitive impairment. On the other hand, 5XFAD mice fed high-fat diet  exhibited much less increase in body weight, white adipose tissue weight, and adipocyte size than their wild-type counterparts. High-fat diet significantly impaired glucose tolerance in wild-type mice but not in 5XFAD mice. Thus, 5XFAD mice had much less susceptibility to high-fat-diet-induced [MASK] disorders than wild-type mice.

      "[CLS] Epigenetic mechanisms are emerging as a fundamental regulatory switch in neuronal function. Acetylation homeostasis governed by the antagonistic activities of HATs and HDACs plays a critical role in neuronal gene activity. It is now becoming increasingly clear that several neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative, and neuropsychiatric disorders are caused by aberrant changes in chromatin acetylation. Several HATs have been shown to be vital for neuronal processes such as synaptic plasticity and memory formation. Thus not surprisingly, dysregulation of such HATs has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases including Huntingtons disease (HD) and Alzheimers disease (AD).

Using solid-state (2)H NMR line shape experiments performed on selectively deuterated methyl groups, we probed the 3-fold symmetric and 2-fold symmetric polymorphs of native Aß as well as the protofibrils of D23N Iowa mutant, associated with an early onset of Alzheimer disease. The dynamics of the  hydrophobic regions probed at Leu-17, Leu-34, Val-36, and Met-35 side chains were found to be very pronounced at all sites and in all polymorphs of Aß, with methyl axis motions persisting down to 230-200 K for most of the sites. The dominant mode of motions is the rotameric side chain jumps, with the Met-35 displaying the most complex multi-modal behavior. There are distinct differences in the dynamics among the three protein variants, with the Val-36 site displaying the most variability. Solvation of the fibrils does not affect methyl group motions within the hydrophobic core of individual cross-ß subunits but has a clear effect on the motions at the hydrophobic interface between the cross-ß subunits, which is defined by Met-35 contacts.

Soaking TTR crystals in a solution containing rhenium tris-carbonyl derivatives yields a  TTR conformer never observed before. Only one of the two monomers of the crystallographic dimer is significantly altered, and the inner part of the T4 binding cavity is expanded at one end and shrunk at the other. The result redefines the mechanism of allosteric communication between the two sites, suggesting that negative cooperativity is a function of dimer asymmetry, which can be induced through internal or external binding.

This study includes three waves of interviews, conducted between July 2010 and July 2012, with 113 purposefully selected respondents (people with beginning to advanced stages of dementia and their informal and professional caregivers) completed in 12 months (285 interviews). Our multilayered qualitative analysis consists of content analysis, timeline methods, and constant comparison. Four decision themes emerged-managing daily life, arranging support, community living, and preparing for the future. Eight key events delineate the decision trajectories of people with dementia. Decisions and key events differ between people with dementia living alone and living with a caregiver. Our study clarifies that decisions relate not only to the disease but to living with the dementia. Individual differences in decision content and sequence may effect shared decision-making and advance care planning. [SEP]\t\tstudying\n",

      "[CLS] INTRODUCTION: Therapeutic strategies targeting Alzheimers disease-related molecule ß- amyloid (Aß), Tau protein and ß-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme (BACE) have been recently explored. However, the treatment effect for single target is not ideal. Based on multiaspect roles of Rho kinase inhibitor Fasudil on neuroprotection, neurorepair and immunomodulation, we observed therapeutic potential of Fasudil and explored possible mechanisms in amyloid precursor protein/ presenilin-1 transgenic (APP/PS1 Tg) mice, an animal model of Alzheimers disease. METHODS: APP/PS1 Tg mice were treated with Fasudil (25 [MASK] for 2 months by intraperitoneal injection. Mouse behavior tests were recorded every day. The expression of Aß deposition, Tau protein phosphorylation, BACE and postsynaptic density 95 (PSD-95) in hippocampus was assayed. The levels in the brain of Toll-like receptors (TLRs)-nuclear factor kappa B/p65(NF-?B/p65)- myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) inflammatory cytokine axis were  measured. RESULTS: Fasudil treatment ameliorated learning and memory deficits, accompanied  by reduced Aß deposition, Tau protein phosphorylation, and BACE expression, as well as increased PSD-95 expression in hippocampus. Fasudil intervention also inhibited TLR-2/4, p-NF-?B/p65, MyD88, interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-a for TLRs-NF-?B-MyD88 inflammatory cytokine axis and the induction of interleukin-10. CONCLUSION: Fasudil exhibited multitarget therapeutic effect in APP/PS1 Tg mice.  The study provides preclinical evidence that Fasudil treatment ameliorated memory deficits in APP/PS1 Tg mice, accompanied by the reduction of Aß deposition and Tau protein phosphorylation, the decrease of BACE and the increase of PSD-95, as  well as inhibition of TLRs-NF-?B-MyD88 inflammatory cytokine axis. However, these results still need to be repeated and confirmed before clinical application. [SEP]\t\tmg/kg/day)\n",

      "[CLS] The amyloid-ß peptide(1-42) (Aß) is a key player in the development and progression of Alzheimers disease (AD). Although much attention is paid to its role in formation of extracellular amyloid plaques and protein aggregates as well as to corresponding mechanisms of their toxicity, good evidence exists that intracellular Aß can accumulate intraneuronally and interact with intracellular target proteins. [MASK] intracellular Aß binding proteins as well as conditions favoring their interactions with Aß are poorly characterized. In this study we have investigated the effect of two known pathogenic Aß modifications, isomerization of Asp7 and phosphorylation of Ser8, on the proteomic profiles of mouse brain Aß binding proteins. Phosphorylation of Ser8 and especially isomerization of Asp7 significantly extended the repertoire of mouse brain Aß binding proteins. [MASK] there were 61 proteins, common for three types of the  affinity ligands. They obviously represent potential targets for direct interaction with all Aß species. Taking into consideration spontaneous mode of Asp7 isomerization and reports on initial accumulation of phosphorylated Aß species inside neurons it is reasonable to suggest that these modifications of intracellular Aß peptides causing the significant increase in the repertoire of Aß binding proteins represent a primary pathogenic effect that precedes formation of extracellular pathogenic oligomerization/aggregation of Aß peptides well described in the literature.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Over the last decades an increasing body of evidence suggested a possible relationship between thyroid hormone (TH) and the ageing process, and several efforts have been made to determine the actual role of TH dynamic during  human life. It is still unclear whether the serum level shift of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone toward higher value, observed during ageing, is a normal adaptive response associated with senescence or an actual mild thyroid dysfunction. A growing body of evidence supports the hypothesis of a reset of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis in order to contrast the catabolic status of  the ageing process. On the other hand, several meta-analyses showed a direct link between subclinical hypothyroidism (sHT) and cardiovascular events (both ischemic heart disease and stroke), although mainly in individuals younger than 65 years.  Similarly, a recent meta-analysis documented consistent data on a positive relationship between sHT and cognitive impairment, but only in individuals younger than 75 years. CONCLUSION: The available data suggest a complex relationship between mild thyroid failure and the ageing process as well as the development and progression of several cardiovascular and neurological diseases. [MASK] this paper, we reviewed the scientific English literature on sHT and the ageing process focusing on experimental evidences related to cognitive impairment and dementia. Moreover, we focused on new patents of treatments potentially able to improve the care of sHT  patients, especially in the elderly, where treatment drawbacks may have negative  impact on the long term outcome.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Neurodegenerative and cognitive disorders are multifactorial diseases (i.e., involving neurodevelopmental, genetic, age or environmental factors) characterized by an abnormal development that affects neuronal function and integrity. Recently, an increasing number of studies revealed that the dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) may be involved in the etiology of cognitive  disorders as Alzheimer, Parkinson, and Huntingtons diseases, Schizophrenia and Autism spectrum disorders. METHODS: From an extensive search in bibliographic databases of peer-reviewed research literature, we identified relevant published studies related to specific key words such as memory, cognition, neurodegenerative disorders, neurogenesis and miRNA. We then analysed, evaluated and summerized scientific evidences derived from these studies. RESULTS: We first briefly summarize the basic molecular events involved in memory, a process inherent to cognitive disease, and then describe the role of miRNAs in neurodevelopment, synaptic plasticity and memory. Secondly, we provide  an overview of the impact of miRNA dysregulation in the pathogenesis of different neurocognitive disorders, and lastly discuss the feasibility of miRNA-based [MASK] in the treatment of these disorders. CONCLUSION: This review highlights the molecular basis of neurodegenerative and cognitive disorders by focusing on the impact of miRNAs dysregulation in these pathological phenotypes. Altogether, the published reports suggest that miRNAs-based therapy could be a viable therapeutic alternative to current treatment options in the future. [SEP]\t\ttherapeutics\n",

      "[CLS] Apolipoprotein (APOE) ?4 genotype has been identified as a risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD). The [MASK] system is mostly involved in AD, and [MASK] deficits represent its key feature. A growing body of studies has focused on the earlier identification of cognitive dysfunctions in younger and older APOE ?4 carriers, but investigation on middle-aged individuals remains rare. Here we sought to investigate if the APOE ?4 genotype modulates declarative [MASK] and its influences on perception in the middle of the life span. We tested 60 middle-aged individuals recruited according to their APOE allele variants (?3/?3, ?3/?4, ?4/?4) on a long-term [MASK]-based orienting of attention task. Results showed that the APOE ?4 genotype impaired neither explicit [MASK] nor [MASK]-based orienting of spatial attention. Interestingly, however, we found that the possession of the ?4 allele broke the relationship between declarative long-term [MASK] and [MASK]-guided orienting of visuo-spatial attention, suggesting an earlier modulation exerted by pure genetic characteristics on cognition. These findings are discussed in light of possible accelerated brain ageing in middle-aged ?4-carriers, and earlier structural changes in the brain occurring at this stage of the lifespan.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Recent advancements in medical imaging have resulted in a significant growth in diagnostic possibilities of neurodegenerative disorders. Neuroanatomical abnormalities of the cerebral cortex in Alzheimers disease (AD), the most frequent type of dementia in the elderly, can be observed in morphology  analysis of cortical sulci, and used to distinguish between cognitively normal (CN) subjects and subjects with AD. OBJECTIVE: The [MASK] of this paper was to extract sulcal features by means of computing a sulcal medial surface for AD/CN classification. METHODS: 24 distinct sulci per subject were extracted from 210 subjects from the  ADNI database by the BrainVISA sulcal identification pipeline. Sulcal medial surface features (depth, length, mean and Gaussian curvature, surface area) were  computed for AD/CN classification with a support vector machine (SVM). RESULTS: The obtained 10-fold cross-validated classification accuracy was 87.9%,  sensitivity 90.0%, and specificity 86.7%, based on ten features. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.89. CONCLUSIONS: The sulcal medial surface features can be used as biomarkers for cortical neuroanatomical abnormalities in AD. All the features were located in the left hemisphere, which had previously been reported to be more severely affected in AD and to lose grey matter faster than the right hemisphere.

      "[CLS] Alzheimers disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive impairment. Currently, there is less knowledge of the involvement of the peripheral biofluid/organ in AD, compared with the central nervous system. In addition, with reported high morbidity in women in particular, it has become very important to explore whether gender difference in the peripheral metabolome is associated with AD. Here, [MASK] investigated metabolic responses of both plasma and liver tissues using an APP/PS1 double mutant transgenic mouse model with NMR spectroscopy, as [MASK]ll as analysis from serum biochemistry and histological staining. Fatty acid composition from plasma and liver extracts was analyzed using GC-FID/MS. We found clear gender differences in AD transgenic mice when compared with their wild-type counterparts. Female AD mice displayed more intensive responses, which [MASK]re highlighted by higher levels  of lipids, 3-hydroxybutyrate and nucleotide-related metabolites, together with lo[MASK]r levels of glucose. These observations indicate that AD induces oxidative stress and impairs cellular energy metabolism in peripheral organs. Disturbances  in AD male mice [MASK]re milder with depletion of monounsaturated fatty acids. We also observed a higher activity of delta-6-desaturate and suppressed activity of  delta-5-desaturate in female mice, whereas inhibited stearoyl-CoA-desaturase in male mice suggested that AD induced by the double mutant genes results in different fatty acids catabolism depending on gender. Our results provide metabolic clues into the peripheral biofluid/organs involved in AD, and [MASK] propose that a gender-specific scheme for AD treatment in men and women may be required.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Neurodegenerative diseases are incurable and debilitating indications with huge social and economic impact, where much is still to be learnt about the  underlying molecular events. Mechanistic disease models could offer a knowledge framework to help decipher the complex [MASK] that occur at molecular and cellular levels. This motivates the need for the development of an approach integrating highly curated and heterogeneous data into a disease model of different regulatory data layers. Although several disease models exist, they often do not consider the quality of underlying data. Moreover, even with the current advancements in semantic web technology, we still do not have cure for complex diseases like Alzheimers disease. One of the key reasons accountable for this could be the increasing gap between generated data and the derived knowledge. RESULTS: In this paper, we describe an approach, called as NeuroRDF, to develop an integrative framework for modeling curated knowledge in the area of complex neurodegenerative diseases. The core of this strategy lies in the usage of well curated and context specific data for integration into one single semantic web-based framework, RDF. This increases the probability of the derived knowledge to be novel and reliable in a specific disease context. This infrastructure integrates highly curated data from databases (Bind, IntAct, etc.), literature (PubMed), and gene expression resources (such as GEO and ArrayExpress). We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach by asking real-world biomedical questions that link these resources to prioritize the plausible biomarker candidates. Among the 13 prioritized candidate genes, we identified MIF to be a potential emerging candidate due to its role as a pro-inflammatory cytokine. We additionally report on the effort and challenges faced during generation of such  an indication-specific knowledge base comprising of curated and quality-controlled data. CONCLUSION: Although many alternative approaches have been proposed and practiced for modeling diseases, the semantic web technology is a flexible and well established solution for harmonized aggregation. The benefit of this work, to use high quality and context specific data, becomes apparent in speculating previously unattended biomarker candidates around a well-known mechanism, further leveraged for experimental investigations.

The study was performed at two trial sites. We studied 136 outpatients with cognitive decline. MRI was performed using a magnetic field of 1.5 and 3 T. Neuropsychological assessment included Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment scale (MoCA), Addenbrookes Cognitive Examination (ACE-R), Cambridge Cognitive Examination battery (CAMCOG) (Part 3), Clock Drawing Test, fluency test and the visual memory test (SCT). CSF was examined for standard parameters such as tau, phosphorylated  tau, amyloid-ß 1-40 and 42 and Qalbumin, in accordance with established protocols and genotype. In 61 patients (45 %), at least 1 CMB was found. Most of the CMBs were described in the amnestic profile (67 %). In 86 % of the cases, multiple CMB were observed. The ratio of Aß1-40/42 in non-amnestic patients with CMB was significantly lower (mean 0.6) than in patients without CMB (mean 1.2). A notable difference in the albumin ratio as an indicator of the BBB was observed between groups with and without CMB. In the CMP-positive group, the E2 genotype was observed more frequently, and the E4 genotype less frequently, than in the CMB-negative group. Based on the cerebrospinal fluid-serum albumin ratio, we were able to show that patients with CMB present several features of BBB dysfunction.  According to logistic regression, the predictive factors for CMB in patients with cognitive decline were age, WMHs score and albumin ratio. We found a significant  reduction in the Aß-amyloid ratio in the non-amnestic profile group with CMB (particularly in the cortical region) in comparison to those without CMB.

      "[CLS] Formation of intracellular plaques and small oligomeric species of amyloid ß (Aß) peptides inside neurons is a hallmark of Alzheimers disease. The most abundant Aß species in the brain are Aß1-40 and Aß1-42, which are composed, respectively,  of 40 and 42 residues. Aß1-42 differs from Aß1-40 only in two residues, Ile41 and Ala42, yet it shows remarkably faster aggregation and greater neurotoxicity than  Aß1-40. Thus, it is crucial to understand the relative [MASK] of Ile41 and Ala42 to these distinct behaviors. To achieve this, secondary structures of the Aß1-41 monomer, which contribute to aggregation propensity, were studied by all-atom molecular dynamics simulation in an implicit solvent and compared to those of Aß1-40 and Aß1-42. We find that the secondary structure populations of Aß1-41 are much closer to those of Aß1-40 than to those of Aß1-42, suggesting that Aß1-41 and Aß1-40 are likely to have similar aggregation properties. This prediction was confirmed through a thioflavin-T aggregation assay.

However, the role of MRTF-A in Alzheimers disease (AD) is still unclear.  Here, we showed that MRTF-A was significantly downregulated in cortex of the Aß25-35-induced AD rats, which played a key role in Aß25-35 induced cerebral neuronal degeneration in vitro. Bilateral intracerebroventricular injection of Aß25-35 caused significantly MRTF-A expression decline in cortex of rats, along with significant neuron apoptosis and plasticity damage.

      "[CLS] An essential feature of Alzheimers disease (AD) is [MASK] accumulation of amyloid-ß (Aß) peptides in [MASK] brain, many years to decades before [MASK] onset of overt cognitive symptoms. We suggest that during this very extended early phase of [MASK]  disease, soluble Aß oligomers and amyloid plaques alter [MASK] function of local neuronal circuits and large-scale networks by disrupting [MASK] balance of synaptic  excitation and inhibition (E/I balance) in [MASK] brain. The analysis of mouse models of AD revealed that an Aß-induced change of [MASK] E/I balance caused hyperactivity in cortical and hippocampal neurons, a breakdown of slow-wave oscillations, as well as network hypersynchrony. Remarkably, hyperactivity of hippocampal neurons precedes amyloid plaque formation, suggesting that hyperactivity is one of [MASK] earliest dysfunctions in [MASK] pathophysiological cascade initiated by abnormal Aß accumulation. Therapeutics that correct [MASK] E/I  balance in early AD may prevent neuronal dysfunction, widespread cell loss and cognitive impairments associated with later stages of [MASK] disease.This article is part of [MASK] [MASK]med issue Evolution brings Ca(2+) and ATP toge[MASK]r to control life and death.

      "[CLS] Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been [MASK] for the potential treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimers disease (AD). Prolonged use of NSAIDs, however, produces gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity.  To overcome this serious limitation, the aim of this study was to develop novel NSAID-derived drug conjugates (Anti-inflammatory-Lipoyl derivatives, AL4-9) that  preserve the beneficial effects of NSAIDS without causing GI problems. As such, we conjugated selected well-known NSAIDs, such as (S)-naproxen and (R)-flurbiprofen, with (R)-a-lipoic acid (LA) through alkylene diamine linkers. The selection of the antioxidant LA was based on the proposed role of oxidative stress in the development and/or progression of AD. Our exploratory studies revealed that AL7 containing the diaminoethylene linker between (R)-flurbiprofen  and LA had the most favorable chemical and in vitro enzymatic stability profiles  among the synthesized compounds. Upon pretreatment, this compound exhibited excellent antioxidant activity in phorbol 12-miristate 13-acetate (PMA)-stimulated U937 cells (lymphoblast lung from human) and Aß(25-35)-treated THP-1 cells (leukemic monocytes). Furthermore, AL7 also modulated the expression  of COX-2, IL-1ß and TNF-a in these cell lines, suggesting anti-inflammatory activity. Taken together, AL7 has emerged as a potential lead worthy of further characterization and testing in suitable in vivo models of AD. [SEP]\t\tsuggested\n",

Little is known about the effect of neurofeedback in patients with [MASK] The objective of this study was to examine whether neurofeedback has a positive effect on cognitive performance in patients with AD. METHODS: Ten patients with qEEG meeting criteria for AD received neurofeedback training. Participants were aged between 61 and 90 years. All patients underwent  the CAMCOG test designed to assess cognitive functioning pre- and post-treatment. RESULTS: The individual results, analyzed with a reliable change index (RCI), showed that patients who received neurofeedback treatment had stable cognitive functions. These patients showed improvement in memory after neurofeedback and other cognitive functions were stable. In addition, an improvement was observed in recall of information and recognition. CONCLUSION: Patients with AD who received neurofeedback treatment had stable or improved cognitive performance. Future research should focus on the design of high quality randomized controlled trials to assess whether neurofeedback has a place in the treatment of AD. [SEP]\t\tdementia.\n",

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Goal oriented cognitive rehabilitation is a promising intervention for individuals diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment [MASK] or dementia due to Alzheimer Disease (AD). Videoconferencing delivered cognitive rehabilitation is a potential avenue for increasing accessibility for rural patients and their families. OBJECTIVE: First, we were concerned with the accessibility of the treatment for individuals in rural and remote areas. Second, client-centered goal setting was explored by asking this sample about their goals for cognitive rehabilitation. METHOD: We mailed questions to all active patients with diagnoses of MCI or dementia due to AD of a rural memory clinic and compare features of the responders versus the non-responders. We asked about interest in videoconferencing delivered treatment and about goals for cognitive rehabilitation, which were thematically analyzed. RESULTS: The responders (N?=?25) were similar to non-responders in severity, depression, and caregiver burden. Of the responders, 80% were interested in videoconferencing developed treatment. A thematic analysis coded 95% of responses as amenable to cognitive rehabilitation. Participants goals were focused on memory, household activities, other cognitive domains, recreation, and higher order tasks.

MMSE-I and Geriatrics Depression Scale were performed on all subjects, Alzheimer patients were also administered Basic Activities of Daily Living (B- ADL). Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) was used to determine the severity of disease, while a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to analyze the [MASK] scores of MMSE-I, and the positive/negative predictive values that were calculated for the optimal [MASK] scores. Internal consistency was measured using Cronbachs coef?cient ?. Additionally, correlations between total MMSE-I score and the CDR, B-ADL, and GDS scores were examined. RESULTS: The MMSE-I scores signi?cantly and inversely correlated with CDR (-0.82, p=0.000) and B-ADL scores (-0.051, p=0.000). The optimal [MASK] points of MMSE-I were 23/24, which yielded a sensitivity of 99.0% - %100.0, a specificity of 98.5% - 97.0%, and an AUC of 1.0/1.0, respectively.

      "[CLS] SIGNIFICANCE: Recently, chronic degenerative diseases have become one of the main health problems worldwide. That is the case of Alzheimers disease (AD) and metabolic syndrome (MetS), whose expression [MASK] be influenced by different risk factors. Recent Advances: In recent decades, it has been widely described that MetS increases the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia. MetS pathogenesis involves several vascular risk factors such as diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and insulin resistance (I/R). CRITICAL ISSUES: Reported evidence shows that vascular risk factors are associated with AD, particularly in the development of protein aggregation, inflammation, oxidative stress, neuronal dysfunction, and disturbances in signaling pathways, with insulin receptor signaling being a common alteration between MetS and AD. FUTURE DIRECTIONS: Insulin signaling has been involved in tau phosphorylation and amyloid ß (Aß) metabolism. However, it has also been demonstrated that Aß oligomers [MASK] bind to insulin receptors, triggering their internalization, decreasing neuron responsiveness to insulin, and promoting insulin I/R. Thus, it  could be argued that Aß could be a convergent factor in the development of both pathologies. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 26, 542-560. [SEP]\t\tcan\n",

      "[CLS] INTRODUCTION: Alzheimers disease ([MASK]), the most common form of dementia, is marked by progressive loss of memory and impairment of cognitive ability. Despite decades of intensive research and scientific advances, the intricate pathogenic mechanisms of [MASK] are still not fully understood and, consequently, an effective treatment is yet to be developed. As widely accepted, the alterations of mitochondrial function are actively engaged in a plethora of neurodegenerative diseases, including [MASK]. With growing interest in the mitochondria as a potential  target for understanding [MASK], it has even been hypothesized that deficits in these organelles may be at the heart of the progression of [MASK] itself. Areas covered: The purpose of this review is to summarize relevant studies that suggest a role for mitochondrial (dys)function in [MASK] and to provide a survey on latest developments regarding [MASK]-related mitochondrial therapeutics. Expert commentary:  As outlined in a plethora of studies, there is no doubt that mitochondria play a  major role in several stages of [MASK] progression. Even though more in-depth studies are needed before pharmaceutical industry can apply such knowledge to human medicine, the continuous advances in [MASK] research field will certainly facilitate  and accelerate the development of more effective preventive or therapeutic strategies to fight this devastating disease.

      "[CLS] Synaptic [MASK] is critical in Alzheimers disease (AD), but the dynamics of synapse turnover are poorly defined. We imaged dendritic spines in transgenic APPswe/PSen1?E9 (APP/PS1) cerebral cortex. Dendritic spine turnover is increased  far from plaque in aged APP/PS1 mice, and in young APP/PS1 mice prior to plaque formation. Dysregulation occurs in the presence of soluble Aß oligomer and requires cellular prion protein (PrPC). APP/PS1 mice lack responsiveness of spine turnover to sensory stimulation. Critically, enhanced spine turnover is coupled with the [MASK] of persistent spines starting early and continuing with age. To evaluate mechanisms of experience-independent supranormal spine turnover, we analyzed the transcriptome of young APP/PS1 mouse brain when turnover is altered  but synapse density and memory are normal, and plaque and inflammation are absent. Early PrPC-dependent expression changes occur in synaptic and lipid-metabolizing genes. Thus, pathologic synaptic dysregulation underlying AD begins at a young age prior to Aß plaque.

Clusterin (apolipoprotein J or ApoJ) is a complement inhibitor [MASK] appears to have a neuroprotective effect in response to tissue damage and has been reported to be upregulated in Alzheimers disease. Here we investigated  the time course and cellular expression pattern of clusterin in human TBI. Tissue from 32 patients with TBI of varying survival times (from under 30 min to 10 months) was examined using immunohistochemistry for clusterin alongside other markers of neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. TBI cases were compared to ischemic brain damage, Alzheimers disease and controls. Double immunofluorescence was carried out in order to examine cellular expression. Clusterin was initially expressed in an axonal location less than 30 min following TBI and increased in intensity and the frequency of deposits with increasing survival time up to 24 h, after which it appeared to reduce in intensity but was still evident several weeks after injury. Clusterin was first evident in astrocytes after 45 min, being increasingly seen up to 48 h but remaining intense in TBI cases with long survival times.

METHODS: We included 20 patients with AD, 15 patients with MCI, and 20 healthy controls, and performed neuropsychological function tests, MRI, as well as (18)F-florbetaben (for amyloid) and (18)F-AV-1451 (for tau) PET scans. By using the regional volume-[MASK]-interest masks extracted from MRIs, regional binding values [MASK] standardized uptake value ratios and volumes were measured. We compared regional binding values among 3 diagnostic groups and identified correlations among the regional binding values, performance in each cognitive function test, and regional atrophy. RESULTS: (18)F-AV-1451 binding was increased only in the entorhinal cortex in patients with MCI, while patients with AD exhibited greater binding in most cortical regions. In the 35 patients with MCI and AD, (18)F-AV-1451 binding in most [MASK] the neocortex increased with a worsening [MASK] global cognitive function.

      "[CLS] Several studies suggest that soluble Amyloid ß (Aß) oligomer-induced aberrant neuronal cell cycle re-entry is the initial trigger for a significant part of the neuronal degeneration and loss in Alzheimers disease (AD). In this study, we investigated the role of Ras, which is a well-known protooncoprotein, in soluble  Aß oligomer-induced aberrant neuronal cell cycle activation and subsequent cell loss using retinoic acid differentiated human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells as model system. In line with previous literature, we showed that in vitro preparations of soluble Aß42 oligomers triggered cell cycle activation but not cell proliferation. As a new finding, we showed that Farnesylthiosalicylic acid (FTS), a specific chemical Ras inhibitor, prevented soluble Aß42 oligomer preparation-induced cell cycle activation. Moreover, we showed that the expression of dominant negative mutant H-Ras (S17N) prevented soluble Aß42 oligomer preparation-induced cell cycle activation, confirming the specific role  of Ras in this pathway. As a possible better mimic of the situation in the AD brain, we prepared soluble oligomers from Aß42 : Aß40 (3:7) peptide mixture and showed that this oligomer preparation similarly induced cell cycle activation which was also inhibited by the Ras inhibitor. Finally, we showed that FTS prevented soluble Aß42 oligomer preparationinduced cell death in our retinoic acid differentiated SH-SY5Y cells. Overall, our results strongly suggest that Ras activity is required for soluble Aß oligomer-induced aberrant neuronal cell cycle reentry and subsequent neuronal [MASK] which are considered important mechanisms in AD pathogenesis.

We  examined THK5351 tracer pharmacokinetics to define an optimal acquisition time for static late images. METHODS: Primary measurements were calculation of regional values of distribution volume ratios (DVR) and standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR) in 6 healthy older control and 10 Alzheimers disease (AD) participants. We examined associations between DVR and SUVR, searching for a 20 min SUVR time window that was stable and comparable to DVR. We additionally examined diagnostic group differences in this 20 min SUVR. RESULTS: In healthy controls, [18F]THK5351 uptake was low, with increased temporal relative to frontal binding. In AD, regional uptake was substantially higher than in healthy controls, with temporal exceeding frontal binding. Retention in cerebellar gray matter, which was used as the reference region, was  low compared to other regions. Both DVR and SUVR values showed minimal change over time after 40 min. SUVR 20-40, 30-50, and 40-60 min were most consistently correlated with DVR; SUVR 40-60 min, the most stable time window, was used in further analyses. Significant (AD > healthy control) group differences existed in temporoparietal regions, with marginal medial temporal differences. We found high basal ganglia SUVR 40-60 min signal, with no group differences. CONCLUSIONS: We examined THK5351, a new PET tracer for measuring tau accumulation, and compared multiple analysis methods for quantifying regional tracer uptake. SUVR 40-60 min performed optimally when examining 20 min SUVR windows, and appears to be a practical method for quantifying relative regional tracer retention.

Based on functional annotation, these loci included genes encoding surface markers of myeloid, lymphoid, or hematopoietic stem cell differentiation (CD69, CD33, CD87), transcription factors regulating lineage specification during hematopoiesis (ASXL1, IRF8, IKZF1, JMJD1C, ETS2-PSMG1), and molecules involved in neutrophil clearance/apoptosis (C10orf54,  LTA), adhesion (TNXB), or centrosome and microtubule structure/function (KIF9, TUBD1). Together with recent reports of somatic ASXL1 mutations among individuals with idiopathic cytopenias or clonal hematopoiesis of undetermined significance,  the identification of a common regulatory 3 UTR variant of ASXL1 suggests that both germline and somatic ASXL1 mutations contribute to lower blood counts in otherwise asymptomatic individuals. These association results shed light on genetic mechanisms that regulate circulating WBC counts and suggest a prominent [MASK] genetic architecture with inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.

      "[CLS] Multiple isoforms of aggregation-prone proteins are present under physiological conditions and have the propensity to assemble into co-oligomers with different properties from self-oligomers, but this process has not been quantitatively studied to date. We have investigated the amyloid-ß (Aß) peptide, associated with [MASK] disease, and the aggregation of its two major isoforms, Aß40 and Aß42, using a statistical mechanical modelling approach in combination with in vitro single-molecule fluorescence measurements. We find that at low concentrations of Aß, corresponding to its physiological abundance, there is little free energy penalty in forming co-oligomers, suggesting that the formation of both self-oligomers and co-oligomers is possible under these conditions. Our model is used to predict the oligomer concentration and size at physiological concentrations of Aß and suggests the mechanisms by which the ratio of Aß42 to Aß40 can affect cell toxicity. An increased ratio of Aß42 to Aß40 raises the fraction of oligomers containing Aß42, which can increase the hydrophobicity of the oligomers and thus promote deleterious binding to the cell membrane and increase neuronal damage. Our results suggest that co-oligomers are a common form of aggregate when Aß isoforms are present in solution and may potentially play a  significant role in [MASK] disease. [SEP]\t\tAlzheimers\n",

      "[CLS] OBJECTIVES: To evaluate frequency of use of two anti-dementia drug classes approved for treatment of symptoms, whether populations most likely to benefit are treated, and correlates of treatment initiation. DESIGN: Nationally representative cohort study. SETTING: Fee-for-service Medi[MASK]. PARTICIPANTS: Elderly adults with dementia enrolled in Medi[MASK] Parts A, B, and D in 2009 (N = 433,559) and a subset with incident dementia (n = 185,449). MEASUREMENTS: Main outcome was any prescription fill for antidementia drugs (cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) or memantine) within 1 year. RESULTS: Treatment with antidementia drugs occurred in 55.8% of all participants  with dementia and 49.3% of those with incident dementia. There was no difference  between ChEIs and memantine use according to dementia severity (measured as death within first year or living in residential [MASK] vs in a community setting) even though memantine is not indicated in mild disease. In incident cases, initiation  of treatment was lower in residential [MASK] (relative risk (RR) = 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.81-0.83) and with more comorbidities (RR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.96-0.96). Sixty percent of participants were managed in primary [MASK] alone. Seeing a neurologist (RR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.06-1.09) or psychiatrist (RR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.16-1.19) was associated with higher likelihood of treatment than seeing a primary [MASK] provider alone, and seeing geriatrician was associated with with lower likelihood (RR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.93-0.99). Across the United States,  the proportion of newly diagnosed individuals started on antidementia treatment varied from 32% to 66% across hospital referral regions. CONCLUSION: Antidementia drugs are used less often in people with late disease, but there is no differentiation in medication choice. Although primary [MASK] providers most often prescribe antidementia medication without specialty support, differences in practice between specialties are evident. [SEP]\t\tcare\n",

To evaluate in a clinical setting the regional distribution patterns of C-Pittsburgh compound B (C-PIB) and the fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (F-FDG) uptake in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), we designed this study. METHODS: We studied 81 consecutive MCI patients, 64 amnestic (A-MCI) and 17 nonamnestic (NA-MCI) by C-PIB and F-FDG PET/computed tomography, by visual analysis. PIB retention [MASK] classified according to the regional distribution into the following patterns: A (frontal, lateral temporal, basal ganglia and anterior cingulate) and B (global retention). F-FDG images were considered positive only if temporoparietal hypometabolism consistent with Alzheimers disease [MASK] observed. RESULTS: In 42 of the 64 A-MCI, C-PIB [MASK] positive. Twelve of the 42 positive A-MCI showed an A-pattern, all F-FDG negative, and 30 a B-pattern, 10 F-FDG positive and 20 F-FDG negative.

A systems biology approach seeks to organize these observed variables into pathways that discriminate those that are highly involved [MASK] causative) from those that are more usefully recognized as bystander effects. We review the evidence that iron dysregulation is one of the central causative pathway elements here, as this can cause each of the above effects. In  addition, we review the evidence that dormant, non-growing bacteria are a crucial feature of AD, that their growth in vivo is normally limited by a lack of free iron, and that it is this iron dysregulation that is an important factor in their resuscitation. Indeed, bacterial cells can be observed by ultrastructural microscopy in the blood of AD patients. A consequence of this is that the growing cells can shed highly inflammatory components such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS).  These too are known to be able to induce (apoptotic and pyroptotic) neuronal cell death. There is also evidence that these systems interact with elements of vitamin D metabolism. This integrative systems approach has strong predictive power, indicating (as has indeed been shown) that both natural and pharmaceutical iron chelators might have useful protective roles in arresting cognitive decline, and that a further assessment of the role of microbes in AD development is more than highly warranted.

To study the interplay between Aß deposition, tau pathology, and microgliosis, we established a new AD transgenic mouse model by crossing 5xfAD mice with Thy-Tau22 transgenic mice.

T5x mice exhibit significant changes in cytokine  production, an almost doubling of microglial number, and a dramatic shift in microglia activation state. Furthermore, T5x microglia exhibit increased phagocytic capacity that enhances the clearance of insoluble Aß and decreasing plaque load.

Therapies targeting Aß are essential for preventing and treating AD. This review focuses on the non-amyloidogenic pathways that prevent the generation of Aß peptide and thereby plaque formation in AD. An a-secretase-dependent cleavage of Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) precludes the amyloidogenic pathway of Aß generation. This non-amyloidogenic a-secretase activation thereby secretes  sAPPa with prominent neurotrophic and memory-enhancing properties. Several \"A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease\" (ADAM) proteins, specifically ADAM17, ADAM10 and ADAM9, comprise active members of this a-secretase family. It is conventionally accepted that whereas ADAM10 executes constitutive APP cleavage, ADAM17 and ADAM9 are dedicated towards the regulated processing. Therefore, promoting a-secretase  activity offers thorough neuroprotection against AD, and emerges as a pertinent strategy in attenuating Aß. We discuss signaling pathways, particularly those mediated by protein kinase C and phorbol esters, that enhance ADAM functioning and sAPPa release. We also elaborate upon the associated M1 and [MASK] acetylcholine receptors, ERK-MAP kinase, tyrosine kinase and calcium signaling pathways. Clinical studies suggest that regulated hormone and cholesterol levels  are essential for restricting neurodegeneration, and here we illustrate the role  of estrogen and testosterone and that of cholesterol-attenuating statins in generating sAPPa.

For technical  replicates, we found both within- and between-array methods did a comparable job  in reducing variance across replicates. For evaluating biological differences, within-array processing always improved differential DNA methylation signal detection over no processing, and always benefitted from performing background correction first.

      "[CLS] Under normal conditions, the function of catalytically active proteases is regulated, in part, by their endogenous inhibitors, and any [MASK] in the synthesis and/or function of a protease or its endogenous inhibitors may result in inappropriate protease activity. Altered proteolysis as a result of an imbalance between active proteases and their endogenous inhibitors can occur during normal aging, and such [MASK]s have also been associated with multiple neuronal diseases, including Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), rare heritable  neurodegenerative disorders, ischemia, some forms of epilepsy, and Alzheimers disease (AD). One of the most extensively studied endogenous inhibitor is the cysteine-protease inhibitor cystatin C (CysC). Changes in the expression and secretion of CysC in the brain have been described in various neurological disorders and in animal models of neurodegeneration, underscoring a role for CysC in these conditions. In the brain, multiple in vitro and in vivo findings have demonstrated that CysC plays protective roles via pathways that depend upon the inhibition of endosomal-lysosomal pathway cysteine proteases, such as cathepsin B (Cat B), via the induction of cellular autophagy, via the induction of cell proliferation, or via the inhibition of amyloid-ß (Aß) aggregation. We review the data demonstrating the protective roles of CysC under conditions of neuronal challenge and the protective pathways induced by CysC under various conditions. Beyond highlighting the essential role that balanced proteolytic activity plays in supporting normal brain aging, these findings suggest that CysC is a therapeutic candidate that can potentially prevent brain damage and neurodegeneration.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Family caregivers are the backbone of the healthcare system. Over time, caregiving takes a tremendous toll on the caregiver. This is particularly true for caregivers who (1) provide >21 h of care/week, and/or (2) support those  experiencing depression, cognitive decline, aggressive [MASK] and life-limiting conditions requiring complex care. Many caregivers face deteriorating physical and mental health, social isolation, family conflict, and  job loss. Caregivers often have little energy or time to access resources and their experiences with the healthcare system, healthcare professionals and service agencies can either buoy them through challenging times, or contribute further to their distress. OBJECTIVE: This project aimed to hear the voices of family caregivers; their challenges, struggles, joys, and motivation for persevering through hardship, as  well as their recommendations regarding education, resources, and supports that might enhance their resilience. METHODS: This community engagement research project utilized an ethnographic, qualitative approach involving three, 2-h focus groups that were analyzed using thematic analysis. FINDINGS: Caregivers identified barriers to resilience, including demands on their time, changing roles and responsibilities, challenges of learning about medical conditions, their own emotional responses, financial strains, changing family dynamics, and personal health. Caregivers also identified several facilitators to resilience, including motivations for caregiving, sense of purpose and validation, spirituality, emotional experiences, and coping strategies. CONCLUSION: Caregivers recommended that educational opportunities, including increasing health care providers education concerning dementias, increased access to resources, system navigators, financial supports, political advocacy, and a more responsive caregiver centered system would support family caregiving.

Genetic variation in miRNAs and miRNA-binding sites may affect miRNA  function and contribute to disease risk. Here, we investigated the extent to which variants within miRNA-related sequences could constitute a part of the functional variants involved in developing Alzheimers disease (AD), using the largest available genome-wide association study of AD. First, among 237 variants  in miRNAs, we found rs2291418 in the miR-1229 precursor to be significantly associated with AD (p-value?=?6.8?×?10(-5), OR?=?1.2). Our in-silico analysis and in-vitro miRNA expression experiments demonstrated that the variants mutant allele enhances the production of miR-1229-3p. Next, we found miR-1229-3p target  genes that are associated with AD and might mediate the miRNA function. We demonstrated that miR-1229-3p directly controls the expression of its top AD-associated target gene (SORL1) using luciferase reporter assays. Additionally, we showed that miR-1229-3p and SORL1 are both expressed in the human brain. Second, among 42,855 variants in miRNA-binding sites, we identified 10 variants (in the 3 UTR of 9 genes) that are significantly associated with AD, including rs6857 that increases the miR-320e-mediated [MASK] of PVRL2.

      "[CLS] Age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers disease (AD) are distressing conditions causing countless levels of suffering for which treatment  is often insufficient or inexistent. Considered to be the most common cause of dementia and an incurable, progressive neurodegenerative disorder, the intricate  pathogenic mechanisms of AD continue to be revealed and, consequently, an effective treatment needs to be developed. Among the diverse hypothesis that have been proposed to explain AD pathogenesis, the one concerning mitochondrial dysfunction has raised as one of the most discussed with an actual acceptance in  the field. It posits that manipulating mitochondrial function and understanding the deficits that result in mitochondrial injury may help to control and/or limit the development of AD. To achieve such goal, the concept of mitochondrial medicine places itself as a promising gathering of strategies to directly manage  the major insidious disturbances of mitochondrial homeostasis as well as attempts to directly or indirectly manage its consequences in the context of AD.

Mechanisms underlying delayed-onset dementia are  complex and may involve vascular and/or neurodegenerative diseases. METHODS: Dementia-free patients with [MASK] and/or transient ischemic attack (TIA; n = 919) were studied for 3 years prospectively, excluding those who developed dementia 3 to 6 months after [MASK] and/or TIA. RESULTS: Forty subjects (4.4%) developed dementia during the study period. Imaging markers of severe small vessel disease (SVD), namely presence of =3 lacunes and confluent white matter changes; history of hypertension and diabetes  mellitus independently predicted delayed-onset dementia after adjustment for age, gender, and education. Only 6 of 31 (19.4%) subjects with delayed cognitive decline harbored Alzheimers disease-like Pittsburg compound B (PiB) retention. Most PiB cases (16/25, 64%) had evidence of severe SVD.

      "[CLS] The dysfunction and loss of synapses in Alzheimer disease are central to dementia symptoms. We have recently demonstrated that pathological Amyloid ß oligomer (Aßo) regulates the association between intracellular protein mediators and the synaptic receptor complex composed of cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) and metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5). Here we sought to determine whether Aßo alters the physiological signaling of the PrP(C)-mGluR5 complex upon glutamate activation. We provide evidence that acute exposure to Aßo as well as chronic expression of familial Alzheimer disease mutant transgenes in model mice  prevents protein-protein interaction changes of the complex induced by the glutamate analog 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine. We further show that 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine triggers the phosphorylation and activation of protein-tyrosine [MASK] 2-ß (PTK2B, also referred to as Pyk2) and of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein [MASK] II in wild-type brain slices but not  in Alzheimer disease transgenic brain slices or wild-type slices incubated with Aßo. This study further distinguishes two separate Aßo-dependent signaling cascades, one dependent on extracellular Ca(2+) and Fyn [MASK] activation and the other dependent on the release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores. Thus, Aßo triggers multiple distinct PrP(C)-mGluR5-dependent events implicated in neurodegeneration and dementia. We propose that targeting the PrP(C)-mGluR5 complex will reverse aberrant Aßo-triggered states of the complex to allow physiological fluctuations of glutamate signaling. [SEP]\t\tkinase\n",

MEASUREMENTS: Outcome was cognitive function assessed using the modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MSE) [MASK] 6 months for up to 7 years. Exposures  were 10 biomarkers measured at baseline: interleukin-2, -6, and -10 (general systemic inflammation); pentraxin 3 (PTX3) and serum amyloid P (SAP) (vascular inflammation); plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, adiponectin, and resistin (metabolic function); receptor for advanced glycation endproduct (oxidative stress); and endothelin-1 (endothelial function). Associations between biomarkers and 3MSE scores (stratified according to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at baseline) were analyzed using Cox regression (outcome: 3MSE decline of =5 points) and mixed-model regression. Bonferroni correction was used to determine significance threshold (P < .0025). RESULTS: In individuals with baseline MCI, PTX3 was associated with a 20% greater hazard of cognitive decline (95% confidence interval = 1.07-1.35), although this  association was no longer statistically significant after adjustment for apolipoprotein (APO)E e4 allele. Adiponectin was associated with faster rate of 3MSE decline in individuals without baseline MCI in mixed-model regression, but the association was similarly attenuated after adjustment for APOE-e4. CONCLUSION: This study did not find strong evidence of the utility of the biomarkers evaluated for identifying individuals at risk of cognitive decline. Future studies investigating the association between PTX3, SAP, and adiponectin and 3MSE scores may be useful. [SEP]\t\tevery\n",

Previous work has shown increasing serotonin levels with selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) compounds reduces Aß in the brain interstitial fluid (ISF) in a mouse model of AD and in the cerebrospinal fluid of humans. We investigated which serotonin receptor (5-HTR) subtypes and downstream effectors were responsible for this reduction. RESULTS: Agonists of 5-HT4R, 5-HT6R, and 5-HT7R significantly reduced ISF Aß, but agonists of other receptor subtypes did not. Additionally, inhibition of Protein  Kinase A (PKA) blocked the effects of citalopram, an SSRI, on ISF Aß levels. Serotonin signaling does not appear to change gene expression to reduce Aß levels in acute timeframes, but likely acts within the cytoplasm to increase a-secretase enzymatic activity. Broad pharmacological inhibition of putative a-secretases increased ISF Aß and blocked the effects of [MASK] CONCLUSIONS: In total, these studies map the major signaling components linking serotonin receptors to suppression of brain ISF Aß.

The aim of this study is to confirm and further elucidate the relationship between peripheral telomere length and Alzheimers disease, cognitive function, and duration of Alzheimers disease. METHODS: In this study, we recruited 165 Han Chinese subjects, consisting of 79 normal controls and 86 patients with AD without family history of AD or vascular  dementia cases. We measured telomere length (T/S ratio) at baseline using quantitative PCR.

Epidemiological and pathophysiological studies showed a link between AD and [MASK], particularly in relation to insulin resistance. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we discuss how [18F] FDG is a marker of glucose metabolism, how insulin resistance is related to [MASK], the link between [MASK] and AD, and how novel treatments for [MASK] could be beneficial in the treatment of Alzheimers disease. We also review few recent patents in the field, suggesting both diagnostic and therapeutic potential approaches. METHODS: The electronic searches were performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases. We also manually searched abstract books and reviewed available recent patents on specific websites. RESULTS: The impaired glucose metabolism in the brain of subject with AD is a widely recognised early feature of the disease; in vivo evaluation with PET is a  useful diagnostic tool.

Although compelling evidence suggests cadmium accumulation has a role in the formation of amyloid-ß plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, which are the hallmarks of Alzheimers disease (AD) pathogenesis, the supporting evidence in humans is limited and conflicting. In this study, we investigated the association between blood cadmium levels and AD mortality among older adults by analyzing the prospective data from the 1999-2004 Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and the Linked Mortality File. METHODS: The data were obtained from the 1999-2004 NHANES and the NHANES (1999-2004) Linked Mortality File. A total of 4,064 participants aged =60 years old with available blood cadmium data and no other missing information on [MASK] questionnaires at baseline were included in this study. AD was denoted as G30 based on the ICD-10 underlying causes of death. RESULTS: Of the 4,064 participants, 51 subjects died as a result of AD. Compared  with participants with low blood cadmium levels (=0.3 µg/L), those with high cadmium levels (>0.6 µg/L) exhibited a 3.83-fold (hazard ratio?=?3.83; 95 % CI?=?1.39-10.59) increased risk of AD mortality.

There is a growing awareness of the importance of palliative care not only in oncological diseases but also in many other branches of medicine, and it appears  particularly evident in the approach to many of the most frequent neurological diseases that are chronic, incurable and autonomy-impairing illnesses. The definition and implementation of palliative goals and procedures in neurology must take into account the specific features of these conditions in terms of the  complexity and variability of symptoms, clinical course, disability and prognosis. The realization of an effective palliative approach to neurological diseases requires specific skills and expertise to adapt the concept of palliation to the peculiarities of these diseases; this approach should be realized through the cooperation of [MASK] services and the action of a multidisciplinary team in which the neurologist should play a central role to identify and face the patients needs. In this view, it is paramount for the neurologist to be trained in these issues to promote the integration of palliative care in the care of neurological patients. [SEP]\t\tdifferent\n",

      "[CLS] Intracellular accumulation [MASK] wild-type tau is a hallmark [MASK] sporadic Alzheimers disease (AD), but the molecular mechanisms underlying tau-induced synapse impairment and memory deficit are poorly understood. Here we found that overexpression [MASK] human wild-type full-length tau (termed hTau) induced memory deficits with impairments [MASK] synaptic plasticity. Both in vivo and in vitro data  demonstrated that hTau accumulation caused remarkable dephosphorylation [MASK] cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) in the nuclear fraction. Simultaneously,  the calcium-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin (CaN) was up-regulated, whereas the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV) was suppressed. Further studies revealed that CaN activation could dephosphorylate CREB and CaMKIV, and the effect [MASK] CaN on CREB dephosphorylation was independent  [MASK] CaMKIV inhibition. Finally, inhibition [MASK] CaN attenuated the hTau-induced CREB dephosphorylation with improved synapse and memory functions.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) associated with Alzheimers Disease (AD) have been linked to structural and functional alterations in fronto-[MASK] circuits and cortical abnormalities. However, little is known on how specific volumetric and functional brain changes may be associated with the frequency, severity and pattern of BPSD. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature regarding neuroimaging and BPSD changes in AD was performed through Pubmed/Medline, ISI, and EMBASE electronic databases from January 2000 to May 2015. Eligible references (n=40) included clinical studies in which structural or functional neuroimaging assessment was performed in AD subjects presenting BPSD features. RESULTS: BPSD symptoms, particularly apathy and psychosis have been associated in most of studies with either volume reductions or decreased metabolism in the prefrontal cortex (orbital and dorsolateral portions), anterior cingulate, insula and [MASK] lobes (middle portion). WM lacunes associated with AD progression have been associated with depressive symptoms. CONCLUSION: The sum of evidence highlights the importance of BPSD-related imaging findings for the understanding of the non-cognitive symptom spectrum in AD. Results suggest that structural and functional changes in fronto-limbic areas may lead to emotional deregulation and symptom unawareness. As these findings may be  present early on the AD clinical course, they may have a relevance for the development of imaging markers that could be used in diagnosis, disease monitoring and prediction of therapeutic response.

      "[CLS] Multiple studies suggest that [MASK]s are affected by Alzheimer disease (AD) more severely and more frequently than males. Other studies have failed to confirm this and the issue remains controversial. Difficulties include differences in study methods and male versus [MASK] life expectancy. Another element of uncertainty is that the majority of studies have lacked neuropathological confirmation of the AD diagnosis. We compared clinical and pathological AD severity in 1028 deceased subjects with full neuropathological examinations. The  age of dementia onset did not differ by gender but [MASK]s were more likely to proceed to very severe clinical and pathological disease, with significantly higher proportions having a Mini-Mental State Examination score of 5 or less and  Braak stage VI neurofibrillary degeneration. Median neuritic plaque densities were similar in [MASK]s and males with AD but [MASK]s had significantly greater tangle density scores. In addition, we found that AD-control brain weight differences were significantly greater for [MASK]s, even after adjustment for age, disease duration, and comorbid conditions. These findings suggest that when  they are affected by AD, [MASK]s progress more often to severe cognitive dysfunction, due to more severe neurofibrillary degeneration, and greater loss of brain parenchyma.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: It is essential to determine the specificity of AV-1451 PET for tau in brain imaging by using pathological comparisons. We performed autoradiography  in autopsy-confirmed [MASK] disease and other neurodegenerative disorders to evaluate the specificity of AV-1451 binding for tau aggregates. METHODS: Tissue samples were selected that had a variety of dementia-related neuropathologies including [MASK] disease, primary age-related tauopathy, tangle predominant dementia, non-[MASK] disease tauopathies, frontotemporal dementia, parkinsonism, Lewy body disease and multiple system atrophy (n?=?38). Brain tissue sections were stained for tau, TAR DNA-binding protein-43, and a-synuclein and compared to AV-1451 autoradiography on adjacent sections. RESULTS: AV-1451 preferentially localized to neurofibrillary tangles, with less binding to areas enriched in neuritic pathology and less mature tau. The strength of AV-1451 binding with respect to tau isoforms in various neurodegenerative disorders was: 3R?+?4R tau (e.g., AD)?>?3R tau (e.g., Pick disease) or 4R tau. Only minimal binding of AV-1451 to TAR DNA-binding protein-43 positive regions was detected. No binding of AV-1451 to a-synuclein was detected. \"Off-target\" binding was seen in vessels, iron-associated regions, substantia nigra, calcifications in the choroid plexus, and leptomeningeal melanin. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced AV-1451 binding in neuritic pathology compared to neurofibrillary tangles suggests that the maturity of tau pathology may affect AV-1451 binding and suggests complexity in AV-1451 binding. Poor association of AV-1451 with tauopathies that have preferential accumulation of either 4R tau or  3R tau suggests limited clinical utility in detecting these pathologies. In contrast, for disorders associated with 3R?+?4R tau, such as [MASK] disease, AV-1451 binds tau avidly but does not completely reflect the early stage tau progression suggested by Braak neurofibrillary tangle staging. AV-1451 binding to TAR DNA-binding protein-43 or TAR DNA-binding protein-43 positive regions can be  weakly positive. Clinical use of AV-1451 will require a familiarity with distinct types of \"off-target\" binding. [SEP]\t\tAlzheimer\n",

      "[CLS] In this study, the inhibitory effects of three phenothiazines [toluidine blue O (TBO), thionine (TH) and methylene violet (MV)] were tested on human plasma butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and their inhibitory mechanisms were [MASK] in detail. MV acted as a linear mixed type inhibitor of human BChE with Ki = 0.66 ± 0.06 µM and a = 13.6 ± 3.5. TBO and TH caused nonlinear inhibition of human BChE, compatible to double occupancy. Ki values estimated by nonlinear regression analysis for TBO and TH were 0.008 ± 0.003 µM and 2.1 ± 0.42 µM, respectively. The inhibitory potential of TBO was also tested on human erythrocyte AChE. TBO acted as a linear mixed type inhibitor of human AChE with Ki = 0.041 ± 0.005 µM and a = 1.6 ± 0.007. Using four site-directed BChE mutants, the role of peripheral anionic site residues of human BChE was also investigated  in the binding of TBO to BChE. The peripheral anionic site mutants of BChE caused 16-69-fold increase in Ki value of TBO, compared to recombinant wild-type, suggesting that peripheral anionic site residues are involved in the binding of TBO to human BChE. In conclusion, TBO which is a potent inhibitor of human cholinesterases, may be a potential drug candidate for the treatment of Alzheimers disease. [SEP]\t\tstudied\n",

BACKGROUND: We recently reported that LLLT applied to the BM enhanced the proliferation of MSCs and their mobilization toward the ischemic heart region, suggesting a possible application of this approach in regenerative medicine and neurodegenerative [MASK] It was also shown that circulating monocytes can infiltrate the brain and reduce brain amyloid load in an Alzheimers disease (AD) mouse model. METHODS AND RESULTS: MSCs from wild-type mice stimulated with LLLT demonstrated an increased ability to maturate toward a monocyte lineage and to increase phagocytosis of soluble Aß in vitro. Furthermore, weekly LLLT for 2 months to the BM, starting at 4 months of age (progressive stage of the disease in these 5XFAD  transgenic male mice), improved memory and spatial learning, compared to a sham-treated AD mouse model. Histology revealed a significant reduction in Aß brain burden in the laser-treated mice compared to the nonlaser-treated ones.

This study served to find out whether awareness of subjective memory complies with objective performance, if differences in awareness are observed longitudinally and whether decrease of awareness can serve as a predictor of AD in MCI p[MASK]ients. METHODS: Thirty-four p[MASK]ients with MCI seeking help in a memory outp[MASK]ient clinic were included. All participants underwent thorough neuropsychological examin[MASK]ion. Awareness of subjective memory was obtained by calcul[MASK]ing difference scores between p[MASK]ient and informant r[MASK]ings on a 16-item questionnaire concerning complaints about loss of memory in every-day life. Retesting was performed after a mean follow-up period of 24 months. RESULTS: Whole group analyses showed th[MASK] awareness remained rel[MASK]ively stable across time. Self-reported memory complaints correl[MASK]ed with episodic memory [MASK] baseline and with performance on a language task [MASK] follow-up. Retests displayed  decrease of awareness. At group level differences in awareness between both times of assessment were not significant for MCI and MCI p[MASK]ients converting to mild AD [MASK] follow-up. The predictive value of awareness was low. CONCLUSIONS: Awareness of subjective memory deficit is linked to episodic memory  function and decreases with decline of cognitive ability.

      "[CLS] Donepezil hydrochloride (DPH) is often used in the treatment of Alzheimers disease. A new treatment method was developed by encapsulating high DPH content in the tips of dissolving microneedles for rapid, transdermal delivery of a predetermined dose of DPH. The microneedles were prepared by a micromolding method using a hydroxy-propyl-methyl-cellulose (HPMC)-ethanol/water mixture (80:20, v/v) for the tips and carboxy-methyl cellulose (CMC)-water for the base of the needles. The micromolding method involved centrifuging a DPH-HPMC-ethanol/water mixture at 10°C to obtain tips with sufficient mechanical  strength. To test their mechanical strength, microneedles with different DPH content were inserted into porcine skin. Then the amount of DPH [MASK] in the microneedles was measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. The efficiency of administering DPH tip-loaded microneedles was investigated using four administrations of a pharmacokinetic test: (1) two oral administration groups (283µg/kg and 692µg/kg) and (2) two microneedle administration groups (283µg/kg and 692µg/kg). High DPH content (up to 78%, w/w) was [MASK] in the microneedle tips without serious loss of mechanical strength by using a mixture of hydroxy-propyl-methyl-cellulose (HPMC) and ethanol/water mixture (80:20, v/v). Because of the distribution of DPH in the tips, 95% of the DPH was  delivered into porcine skin after 5min of insertion. As measured by Cmax and AUC, transdermal delivery of DPH tip-loaded microneedles was more effective compared to oral administration of the same dose of DPH. Transdermal delivery could replace oral administration of DPH. [SEP]\t\tencapsulated\n",

Some peripheral immune responses are altered due to neuroinflammation in colchicine induced AD (cAD) rats. The leaky blood brain barrier (BBB) in cAD-rats [MASK] be involved in inducing peripheral inflammation, though there is no report in this regard. Therefore, the present study was designed to investigate the role of BBB in cADrats by altering the BBB in a time  dependent manner with injection (i.v.) of mannitol (BBB opener). The inflammatory markers in the brain and serum along with the peripheral immune responses were measured after 30 and 60min of mannitol injection in cAD rats. The results showed higher inflammatory markers in the hippocampus and serum along with alterations in peripheral immune parameters in cAD rats. Although the hippocampal inflammatory markers did not further change after mannitol injection in cAD rats, the serum inflammatory markers and peripheral immune responses were altered and these changes were greater after 60min than that of 30min of mannitol injection.  The present study shows that the peripheral immune responses in cAD rats after 30 and 60min of mannitol injection are related to magnitude of impairment of BBB in  these conditions. It can be concluded from this study that impairment of BBB in cAD rats is related to the changes of peripheral immune responses observed in that condition. [SEP]\t\tmay\n",

METHODS AND ANALYSIS: HATICE is a multinational, multicentre, prospective, randomised, open-label blinded end point (PROBE) trial with 18 months intervention. Recruitment of 2600 older people (=65 years) at increased [MASK] of cardiovascular disease will take place in the Netherlands, Finland and France. Participants randomised to the intervention condition will have access to an interactive internet platform, stimulating self-management of vascular [MASK] factors, with remote support by a coach.

Caregivers were hypothesized to experience significantly poorer outcomes than non-caregivers. METHODS: Data were combined from the 2012 and 2013 National Health and Wellness Survey in Japan (n?=?60000). Caregivers for adult relatives [MASK] AD or dementia were compared [MASK] non-caregivers on: comorbidities (including Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) cutoff scores suggesting presence/absence of major depressive disorder (MDD)), Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI), SF-36v2-based HRQoL, and healthcare resource utilization. Sociodemographic characteristics, health characteristics and behaviors, and Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) scores were compared across groups. Propensity matching, based on scores generated from a logistic regression predicting caregiving, was used to match caregivers [MASK] non-caregivers [MASK] similar likelihood of being caregivers. Bivariate comparisons across matched groups served to estimate outcomes differences due to caregiving. RESULTS: Among 55060 respondents, compared [MASK] non-caregivers (n?=?53758), caregivers (n?=?1302) were older (52.6 vs. 47.5 years), more frequently female (53 % vs. 49 %), married/partnered, frequent alcohol drinkers, current smokers, exercisers, and not employed, and they averaged higher CCI scores (0.37 vs. 0.14), all p?<?0.05. Propensity scores incorporated sex, age, body mass index (BMI), exercise, alcohol, smoking, marital status, CCI, insured status, education, employment, income, and children in household. A greedy matching algorithm produced 1297 exact matches, excluding 5 non-matched caregivers. Health utilities scores were significantly lower among caregivers (0.724) vs. non-caregivers (0.764), as were SF-36v2 Physical and Mental Component Summary scores. Caregivers vs. non-caregivers had significantly higher absenteeism, presenteeism-related impairment, overall work impairment (25.8 % vs. 20.4 %, respectively), and activity impairment (25.4 % vs. 21.8 %), more emergency room and traditional provider visits (7.70 vs. 5.35) in the past six months, and more  frequent MDD (14 % vs. 9 %), depression, insomnia, anxiety, and pain. CONCLUSIONS: Those providing care for patients [MASK] AD or dementia in Japan experienced significantly poorer HRQoL and greater comorbid risk, productivity impairment, and resource use. These findings inform the need for greater support  for caregivers and their patients. [SEP]\t\twith\n",

      "[CLS] Polysialated neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) is a membrane bound glycoprotein widely expressed during nervous system development. While commonly described in the neurogenic niches of the adult human brain, [MASK] is limited evidence of its distribution in other brain regions. PSA-NCAM is an important regulator of cell-cell interactions and facilitates cell migration and plasticity. Recent evidence suggests these functions may be altered in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers (AD) and Parkinsons disease (PD). This study provides a detailed description of the PSA-NCAM distribution throughout the human brain and quantitatively compares the staining load in cortical regions and sub-cortical structures between the control, AD and PD brain. Our results provide evidence of widespread, yet specific, PSA-NCAM expression throughout the human brain including regions devoid of PSA-NCAM in the rodent brain such as the caudate nucleus (CN) and cerebellum (CB). We also detected a significant reduction in PSA-NCAM load in the entorhinal cortex (EC) of cases that was inversely correlated with hyperphosphorylated tau load.

      "[CLS] Cholinergic vulnerability, characterized by loss of acetylcholine (ACh), is one of the hallmarks of Alzheimers disease (AD). Previous work has suggested that decreased ACh activity in AD may contribute to pathological changes through global alterations in alternative splicing. This occurs, at least partially, via  the regulation of the expression of a critical protein family in RNA processing,  heterogeneous nuclear [MASK] (hnRNP) A/B proteins. These proteins regulate several steps of RNA metabolism, including alternative splicing, RNA trafficking, miRNA export, and gene expression, providing multilevel surveillance in RNA functions. To investigate the mechanism by which cholinergic tone regulates hnRNPA2/B1 expression, we used a combination of genetic mouse models and in vivo and in vitro techniques. Decreasing cholinergic tone reduced levels of hnRNPA2/B1, whereas increasing cholinergic signaling in vivo increased expression of hnRNPA2/B1. This effect was not due to decreased hnRNPA2/B1 mRNA expression, increased aggregation, or degradation of the protein, but rather to decreased mRNA translation by nonsense-mediated decay regulation of translation.  Cell culture and knock-out mice experiments demonstrated that M1 muscarinic signaling is critical for cholinergic control of hnRNPA2/B1 protein levels. Our experiments suggest an intricate regulation of hnRNPA2/B1 levels by cholinergic activity that interferes with alternative splicing in targeted neurons mimicking  deficits found in AD.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: In Alzheimers disease, degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons is an early event. These neurons communicate with target cells and regulate their long-term activity by poorly understood mechanisms. Recently, the splicing factor hnRNPA2/B, which is decreased in Alzheimers disease, was implicated as a potential mediator of long-term cholinergic regulation. Here, we demonstrate a mechanism by which cholinergic signaling controls the translation of hnRNPA2/B1 mRNA by activation of M1 muscarinic type receptors. Loss of cholinergic activity can have profound effects in target cells by modulating hnRNPA2/B1 levels. [SEP]\t\tribonucleoprotein\n",

Thirty-six proteins, including several involved in neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity (e.g., GRIA1, GRM3, and SYN1), were altered in both normal aging and AD. Pathway analysis highlighted HDAC4 as a regulator of observed protein changes in both genotypes and identified the REST epigenetic regulatory pathway and Gi intracellular signaling as AD-specific pathways involved in regulating the onset of memory deficits. Comparing the hippocampal membrane proteome of Ntg versus AD, regardless of cognitive [MASK], identified 138 differentially expressed proteins, including confirmatory proteins APOE and CLU. Overall, we provide a novel list of putative  targets and pathways with therapeutic potential, including a set of proteins associated with cognitive [MASK] in normal aging mice or gene mutations that cause AD.

Behavioral and psychological symptoms [MASK] dementia (BPSD) such as agitation, aggression, and resistance to care occur in nearly all individuals over the course [MASK] their illness. In inpatient care settings, if not appropriately treated, BPSD can result in care complications, increased length [MASK] stay, dissatisfaction with care, and caregiver stress and injury.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Individuals with Lewy body Dementia (LBD), which encompasses both Parkinson disease dementia (PDD) and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) experience functional decline through Parkinsonism and sedentariness exacerbated by motor, psychiatric and cognitive symptoms. Exercise may improve functional outcomes in Parkinsons disease (PD), and Alzheimers disease (AD). However, the multi-domain nature of the LBD cluster of symptoms (physical, cognitive, psychiatric, autonomic) results in vulnerable [MASK] often being excluded from exercise studies evaluating physical function in PD or cognitive function in dementia to avoid confounding results. This review evaluated existing literature reporting the effects of exercise interventions or physical activity (PA) exposure on cluster symptoms in LBD. METHODS: A high-sensitivity search was executed across 19 databases. Full-length  articles of any language and quality, published or unpublished, that analysed effects of isolated exercise/physical activity on indicative Dementia with Lewy Bodies or PD-dementia cohorts were evaluated for outcomes inclusive of physical,  cognitive, psychiatric, physiological and quality of life measures. The protocol  for this review (Reg. #: CRD42015019002) is accessible at http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/. RESULTS: 111,485 articles were initially retrieved; 288 full articles were reviewed and 89.6% subsequently deemed ineligible due to exclusion of participants with co-existence of dementia and Parkinsonism. Five studies (1 uncontrolled trial, 1 randomized controlled trial and 3 case reports) evaluating  16 participants were included. Interventions were diverse and outcome homogeneity was low. Habitual gait speed outcomes were measured in 13 participants and increased (0.18m/s, 95% CI -0.02, 0.38m/s), exceeding moderate important change (0.14m/s) for PD cohorts. Other outcomes appeared to improve modestly in most participants. DISCUSSION: Scarce research investigating exercise in LBD exists. This review confirms exercise studies in PD and dementia consistently exclude LBD participants. Results in this cohort must be treated with caution until robustly  designed, larger studies are commissioned to explore exercise efficacy, feasibility and clinical relevance.

      "[CLS] OBJECTIVE: To verify the hypothesis that aberrant placental mRNA genes related to cardiogenesis can be detected in maternal plasma at the second trimester of pregnancy. METHODS: NanoString technology was used to identify aberrant genes, comparing 39  women carrying a fetus with a congenital heart defect (CHD) to 31 controls at 19-24?weeks of gestation. The genes with differential expression were subsequently tested using real time polymerase chain reaction. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used to combine all the mRNA species with discriminant ability for CHD. A multivariable receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve having the estimated discriminant score as an explanatory variable was generated. RESULTS: Six genes with differential expression, namely FALZ, [MASK] PRKACB, SAV1, STK4 and TNXB2, were found. The ROC curve yielded a detection rate of 66.7% at a false positive rate of 10%. A higher discriminant score (>75(th) centile) was reached for 14 CHD cases (82.4%) and only 1 control (5.8%). Two cases (11.8%) of heart rhythm disorders also yielded a discriminant score value >75(th) centile. CONCLUSION: These data represent a step forward in the screening of CHDs.

This was despite higher [MASK] thermogenic activity, as evidenced by brown adipose tissue norepinephrine content and uncoupling protein 1 expression. A 24-hour exposure to cold (4 °C) aggravated key neuropathologic markers of AD such as: tau phosphorylation, soluble amyloid beta concentrations, and synaptic protein loss in the cortex of 3×Tg-AD mice.

Slow wave activity in the frontal regions was also similar when comparing the [MASK] EEG device to polysomnography.

Other sleep parameters, such as sleep latency and rapid eye movement (REM) onset latency, had decreased agreement.

      "[CLS] Alzheimers disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system correlated with the progressive loss of cognition and memory. ß-Amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles and the deficiency in cholinergic neurotransmission constitute the major hallmarks of the AD. Two major hypotheses have been implicated in the pathogenesis of AD namely the cholinergic  hypothesis which ascribed the clinical features of dementia to the deficit cholinergic neurotransmission and the amyloid cascade hypothesis which emphasized on the deposition of insoluble peptides formed due to the faulty cleavage of the  amyloid precursor protein. Current pharmacotherapy includes mainly the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor agonist which offer symptomatic therapy and does not address the underlying cause of the disease.

      "[CLS] Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive decline leading to dementia. The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a ubiquitous type I transmembrane (TM) protein sequentially processed to generate the ß-amyloid peptide (Aß), the major constituent of senile plaques that are typical AD lesions. [MASK] is a growing body of evidence that soluble Aß oligomers correlate with clinical symptoms associated with the disease. The Aß sequence begins in the extracellular juxtamembrane region of APP and includes roughly half of the TM domain. This region contains GXXXG and GXXXA motifs, which are critical for both TM protein interactions and fibrillogenic properties of peptides derived from TM a-helices.  Glycine-to-leucine mutations of these motifs were previously shown to affect APP  processing and Aß production in cells. However, the detailed contribution of these motifs to APP dimerization, their relation to processing, and the conformational changes they can induce within Aß species remains undefined. Here, we describe highly resistant Aß42 oligomers that are produced in cellular membrane compartments. They are formed in cells by processing of the APP amyloidogenic C-terminal fragment (C99), or by direct expression of a peptide corresponding to Aß42, but not to Aß40. By a point-mutation approach, we demonstrate that glycine-to-leucine mutations in the G(29)XXXG(33) and G(38)XXXA(42) motifs dramatically affect the Aß oligomerization process. G33 and  G38 in these motifs are specifically involved in Aß oligomerization; the G33L mutation strongly promotes oligomerization, while G38L blocks it with a dominant  effect on G33 residue modification. Finally, we report that the secreted Aß42 oligomers display pathological properties consistent with their suggested role in AD, but do not induce toxicity in survival assays with neuronal cells. Exposure of neurons to these Aß42 oligomers dramatically affects neuronal differentiation  and, consequently, neuronal network maturation. [SEP]\t\tThere\n",

      "[CLS] In the central nervous system endothelial nitric oxide (NO) is an essential molecule responsible for the preservation of the functional integrity of the neurovascular unit. NO causes vasodilatation and is an important inhibitor of platelet aggregation, smooth muscle cell proliferation, and white blood cell adhesion. In addition, endothelium-derived NO exerts anti-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic effects. More recently, it has been recognized that endothelial NO modulates the expression and processing of amyloid precursor protein in cerebrovascular endothelium and neuronal tissue. Studies in endothelial NO synthase [MASK] knockout mice indicate that endothelial NO functions as a neurovascular protective molecule during aging. Indeed, genetic inactivation of eNOS exacerbates the detrimental effects of aging on cerebrovascular, microglial, and neuronal functions as well as on cognition.

However, it is unclear whether glymphatic transport affects the distribution of soluble Aß in Alzheimers disease (AD). In wild type mice, we show that Aß40 (fluorescently labeled Aß40 or unlabeled Aß40), was distributed from CSF to brain, via the peri-arterial space, and associated with neurons. In contrast, Aß42 was mostly restricted to the peri-arterial space due mainly to its greater propensity to oligomerize when compared to Aß40. Interestingly, pretreatment with Aß40 in the CSF, but not Aß42, reduced CSF transport into brain. In APP/PS1 mice, a model of AD, with and without extensive amyloid-ß deposits, glymphatic transport was reduced, due to the accumulation of toxic Aß species, such as soluble oligomers. CSF-derived Aß40 co-localizes with existing endogenous vascular and parenchymal amyloid-ß plaques, and thus, may contribute to the progression of both cerebral amyloid angiopathy and parenchymal Aß accumulation.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Alzheimers disease (AD) is a progressive, multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder that is the main cause of dementia globally. AD is associated with increased [MASK] stress, resulting from imbalance in production and clearance of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS can damage DNA and other macromolecules, leading to genome instability and disrupted cellular functions. Base excision repair (BER) plays a major role in repairing [MASK] DNA lesions. Here, we compared the expression of BER components APE1, OGG1, PARP1 and Polß in blood and postmortem brain tissue from patients with AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and healthy controls (HC). RESULTS: BER mRNA levels were correlated to clinical signs and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for AD. Notably, the expression of BER genes was higher in brain tissue than in blood samples. Polß mRNA and protein levels were significantly higher in the cerebellum than in the other brain regions, more so in AD patients  than in HC. Blood mRNA levels of OGG1 was low and PARP1 high in MCI and AD. CONCLUSIONS: These findings reflect the [MASK] stress-generating energy-consumption in the brain and the importance of BER in repairing these damage events. The data suggest that alteration in BER gene expression is an event preceding AD. The results link DNA repair in brain and blood to the etiology of AD at the molecular level and can potentially serve in establishing novel biomarkers, particularly in the AD prodromal phase.

      "[CLS] Iron deposition in the brain is a feature of normal aging, though in several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimers disease, the rate of iron [MASK] is more advanced than in age-matched controls. Using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry imaging we present here a pilot study that quantitatively assessed the iron content of white and gray matter in paraffin-embedded sections from the frontal cortex of Alzheimers and control subjects. Using the phosphorus image as a confirmed proxy for the white/gray matter boundary, we found that increased intrusion of iron into gray matter occurs in the Alzheimers brain compared to controls, which may be indicative of either a loss of iron homeostasis in this vulnerable brain region,  or provide evidence of increased inflammatory processes as a response to chronic  neurodegeneration. We also observed a trend of increasing iron within the white matter of the frontal cortex, potentially indicative of disrupted iron metabolism preceding loss of myelin integrity. Considering the known potential toxicity of excessive iron in the brain, our results provide supporting evidence for the continuous development of novel magnetic resonance imaging approaches for assessing white and gray matter iron [MASK] in Alzheimers disease.

      "[CLS] Because of the age of persons diagnosed with younger-onset Alzheimers disease or other dementias (YOD), an important and as yet relatively little explored area of YOD, particularly in the United States, is the impact on young children of having a parent with YOD.

      "[CLS] Alzheimers disease is a multifactorial disease that is characterized mainly by Amyloid-ß (A-ß) deposits, cholinergic deficit and extensive metal (copper, iron)-induced oxidative stress. In this work we present details of the synthesis, antioxidant and copper-chelating properties, DNA protection study, cholinergic activity and amyloid-antiaggregation properties of new multifunctional tacrine-7-hydroxycoumarin hybrids. The mode of interaction between copper(II) and hybrids and interestingly, the reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I) species (for complexes Cu-5e-g) were confirmed by EPR measurements. EPR spin trapping on the model Fenton reaction, using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) as a spin trap, demonstrated a significantly suppressed formation of hydroxyl radicals for  the Cu-5e complex in comparison with free copper(II). This suggests that compound 5e upon coordination to free copper ion prevents the Cu(II)-catalyzed decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, which in turn may alleviate oxidative stress-induced damage. Protective activity of hybrids [MASK] and 5e against DNA damage in a Fenton system (copper catalyzed) was found to be in excellent agreement with the EPR spin trapping study. Compound 5g was the most effective in the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (hAChE, IC50=38nM) and compound 5b was the most potent inhibitor of butyrylcholinesterase (hBuChE, IC50=63nM). Compound [MASK] was the strongest inhibitor of A-ß1-40 aggregation, although a significant inhibition (>50%) was detected for compounds 5b, 5d, 5e and 5g. Collectively, these results suggest that the design and investigation of multifunctional agents containing along with the acetylcholinesterase inhibitory segment also an antioxidant moiety capable of alleviating metal (copper)-induced oxidative stress, may be of importance in the treatment of Alzheimers disease.

      "[CLS] Parkinson disease (PD) is second only to Alzheimer disease as the most common human neurodegenerative disorder. Despite intense investigation, no interdictive  therapy is available for PD. Recent studies indicate that both innate and adaptive immune processes are active in PD. Accordingly, we found a rapid increase in [MASK] (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) and eotaxin, chemokines that are involved in T cell trafficking, in vivo in the substantia nigra pars compacta and the serum of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-intoxicated mice. [MASK] and  eotaxin were also up-regulated in the substantia nigra pars compacta of post-mortem PD brains as compared with age-matched controls. Therefore, we investigated whether neutralization of [MASK] and eotaxin could protect against nigrostriatal degeneration in MPTP-intoxicated mice. Interestingly, after peripheral administration, functional blocking antibodies against [MASK] and eotaxin reduced the infiltration of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells into the nigra, attenuated nigral expression of proinflammatory molecules, and suppressed nigral  activation of glial cells. These findings paralleled dopaminergic neuronal protection, normalized striatal neurotransmitters, and improved motor functions in MPTP-intoxicated mice. Therefore, we conclude that attenuation of the chemokine-dependent adaptive immune response may be of therapeutic benefit for PD patients. [SEP]\t\tRANTES\n",

      "[CLS] OBJECTIVES: Prominent impairment of visuospatial processing is a feature of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and diagnosis of this impairment may help clinically distinguish DLB from Alzheimers disease (AD). The current study compared autopsy-confirmed DLB and AD patients on the Hooper Visual Organization  Test ([MASK]), a test that requires perceptual and mental reorganization of parts of an object into an identifiable whole. The [MASK] may be particularly sensitive to DLB since it involves integration of visual information processed in separate dorsal and ventral visual \"streams\". METHODS: Demographically similar DLB (n=28), AD (n=115), and normal control (NC;  n=85) participants were compared on the [MASK] and additional neuropsychological tests. Patient groups did not differ in dementia severity at time of [MASK] testing. High and Low AD-Braak stage DLB subgroups were compared to examine the influence  of concomitant AD pathology on [MASK] performance. RESULTS: Both patient groups were impaired compared to NC participants. [MASK] scores of DLB patients were significantly lower than those of AD patients. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the [MASK] for patients versus controls was good, but marginal for DLB versus AD. High-Braak and low-Braak DLB patients did not differ on the [MASK], but High-Braak DLB performed worse than Low-Braak DLB  on tests of episodic memory and language. CONCLUSIONS: Visual perceptual organization ability is more impaired in DLB than  AD but not strongly diagnostic. The disproportionate severity of this visual perceptual deficit in DLB is not related to degree of concomitant AD pathology, which suggests that it might primarily reflect Lewy body pathology.

An accurate profile of the relationship between cytokines and  Alzheimers disease (AD) pathogenesis, as well as the patterns of these inflammatory mediators in AD patients could lead to the identification of peripheral markers for the disease. The present study was undertaken to identify  pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines associated with AD in the Malaysian population. METHODS: Further to informed consent from 39 healthy subjects and 39 probable AD  patients, 8.5?mL of peripheral blood was collected and serum was extracted. The differential levels of 12 serum cytokines extracted from peripheral blood samples were measured using Procarta Multiplex Cytokine and enzyme-linked immunoassay kits. Concentrations of cytokines were measured at 615?nm using a fluorometer. [MASK] Except for tumor necrosis factor-a, all classical pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1ß, IL-6, IL-12 and interferon-?) were found to be significantly upregulated (P?<?0.001) in AD patients. Three of the five non-classical pro-inflammatory cytokines (C-X-C motif ligand?10 [CXCL-10], monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and macrophage inflammatory protein-1a) showed similar patterns. Both classical IL-10 and non-classical IL-13 anti-inflammatory  cytokines were significantly downregulated (P?<?0.001) in AD patients when compared with non-AD controls. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses for both CXCL-10 (IP-10) and IL-13 showed a high level of diagnostic accuracy (area under curve?=?1 [95% confidence interval]). Both CXCL-10 and IL-13 also showed sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 100% for diagnosis of AD (cut-off values >53.65??g/mL and <9.315??g/mL, respectively).

METHODS: This outpatient memory clinic-based intervention study included a pre-/post-test survey design with two nonequivalent groups and predominately serves Hispanic and African Americans. Of 60 eligible caregivers, 67% participated in a tailored, safety training class with an optional follow-up call. RESULTS: The results indicate a reduction in some safety risks compared to baseline and/or a no intervention group, respectively, including leaving patients at home alone part-time (p < .01 and p < [MASK] getting lost (p < .05 and p < .05), going outdoors alone less often (p < .05 and p < [MASK] and giving themselves medicine (p < .05 and p < .01). At post-test, 47 clinically significant instances occurred, in which caregivers who participated in the intervention self-reported patients living with AD to be completely safe in one or more of the safety risk items compared to 8 instances among those who did not. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot pre/post design with non-equivalent groups study needs refinement in a future randomized control trial.

RECENT FINDINGS: Cognitive interventions appear to be promising in [MASK] disease and Parkinsons disease. Although feasibility has been shown in mild cognitive impairment, early [MASK] disease, and mild to moderate Parkinsons disease, studies to investigate long-term efficacy and mechanisms underlying these interventions are still needed. SUMMARY: There is a need to conduct scientifically rigorous studies to validate the efficacy of cognitive intervention trials. Future studies will greatly benefit from including longitudinal imaging in their study design. Imaging can be used to demonstrate the efficacy and mechanisms by measuring brain changes over the intervention period. Imaging can also be used to determine biological and disease-related factors that may influence the treatment response, that is, the effect modifiers. Consideration of effect modifiers will allow us to measure the  treatment response in biomarkers and cognition with greater sensitivity and also  aid in designing trials that will lead to better patient outcomes.

The  aim of this study was to investigate the neuropsychiatric symptoms of PDD compared to DLB and AD. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case-control study on 125 newly diagnosed consecutive PDD patients and age- and dementia stage-matched controls with either DLB (N = 250) or AD (N = 500) who visited the same hospital over the same period. For each case and control, neuropsychiatric symptoms were assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). RESULTS: Overall, 513 (58.6%) patients were female and 362 (41.4%) were male. Comparisons of [MASK] data revealed that the PDD group, similar to the AD group, had a lower NPI total score, NPI caregiver burden score, and rate of antipsychotic use (all p < 0.001) than the DLB group. One or more psychiatric symptoms were reported in 95.2% of the PDD, 99.2% of the DLB, and 96.8% of the AD patients. The PDD group had lower subscores in the items of delusions, hallucinations, agitation, anxiety, irritation, aberrant motor behavior compared  to the DLB group. Severe neuropsychiatric symptoms among all dementia patients were associated with younger age, more advanced stage, and a diagnosis of DLB.

      "[CLS] OBJECTIVE: Impairment of visual perception frequently occurs in Alzheimers disease (AD) and can cause severe constraints in daily activities. The nonverbal  Ravens Colored Progressive Matrices (RCPM) test consists of sets A, AB, and B and is easily performed in a short time to evaluate both visual perception and reasoning ability. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the neural basis of  visual perception and reasoning ability in patients with AD using RCPM and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). METHODS: Fifty patients who fulfilled the National Institute on Aging/Alzheimers Association criteria for [MASK] AD dementia were examined with RCPM and SPECT.  All SPECTs were performed using N-isopropyl-p-[123 I]-iodoamphetamine. A multiple regression model was used to perform multivariate analyses of the relationships between regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and RCPM scores. RESULTS: There was a significant positive correlation between RCPM total score and rCBF in the inferior parietal lobes bilaterally, the right inferior temporal  gyrus, and the right middle frontal gyrus. Set A was positively correlated with rCBF in the right temporal and right parietal lobes. Set AB was positively correlated with rCBF in the right temporal, right parietal, and right frontal lobes. Set B was positively correlated with rCBF in the right parietal and right  frontal lobes. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that deteriorations of specific brain regions are associated with dysfunction of visual perception and reasoning ability in AD.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Self-rated health (SRH) has in many population-based studies predicted adverse health outcomes, e.g. morbidity, permanent nursing home (NH) placement, and mortality. However, [MASK] predictive value of SRH to NH placement and mortality among elderly people is not consistent. This may be due to cognitive impairment. Since [MASK] SRH item is widely used, it is important to know  whe[MASK]r SRH has different predictive value among people with cognitive impairments. We aimed to examine SRH and [MASK] risk of permanent NH placement and mortality among people with mild Alzheimers disease (AD). METHODS: Data are from The Danish Alzheimer Intervention StudY (DAISY), a large randomized controlled trial of psychosocial intervention for patients with mild dementia and [MASK]ir caregivers with 3-years follow-up. Five out of 14 Danish counties participated and 321 home-living elderly (mean age: 76.2 years) with mild AD (46.4 % male) were included during 2004 and 2005. Self-rated SRH, cognitive function (MMSE), quality of life (proxy-rated QOL-AD), activities of daily living (ADCS-ADL), insight, and socio-demographics were assessed at baseline. Comorbidities and information about NH placement and mortality was obtained over 3-years follow-up from registries. With Cox proportional hazard regression we analysed [MASK] association between SRH (dichotomised into good vs. poor) and NH placement and mortality adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: At baseline 66 % reported excellent or good, and 34 % fair, poor or very poor SRH. Mean MMSE was 24.0 (range: 20-30). NH placement and mortality totalled  28.1 % and 16.5 % at 3-years follow-up, respectively. Poor SRH at baseline was not related to increased risk of NH placement or to increased mortality nei[MASK]r in [MASK] univariable nor in multivariable analysis: In [MASK] fully adjusted models HR was 0.63 (95 % CI 0.38-1.05) and 1.28 (95 % CI 0.67-2.45), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: When poor SRH was present we found no increased risk for NH placement or death among elderly people with mild AD. SRH is a widely used parameter in clinical and epidemiological research but may not be a valid indicator of health in patients with AD due to loss of insight. [SEP]\t\tthe\n",

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Alzheimers disease (AD) is a common and severe neurodegenerative disorder. Human telomeres are fundamental for the maintenance of genomic stability and play prominent roles in both cellular senescence and organismal aging. Regulation of telomere length (TL) is the result of the complex interplay  between environmental and genetic factors. Alterations in TL are increasingly being studied as a possible risk factor for AD, and published studies on TL in AD show discrepant results, highlighting the need for a meta-analysis. METHODS: In the current study, we carried out a meta-analysis of published studies of TL in AD patients and healthy controls. PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases (from inception to September 2015) were [MASK] to identify relevant articles reporting TL in humans with AD, from which we retrieved data such as sample size, experimental methods, and mean TL for cases and controls. A  random-effects model was [MASK] for meta-analytical procedures. RESULTS: The meta-analysis included 13 primary studies and demonstrated a significant difference in TL between 860 AD patients and 2,022 controls, with a standardized mean difference of -0.984 (confidence interval: -1.433 to -0.535; p  value: <.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our results show a consistent evidence of shorter telomeres in AD patients and highlight the importance of the analysis of epigenomic markers associated with neurodegeneration and with the risk for common and severe neurological diseases, such as AD.

We also found that the specific NGF receptor, Tyr kinase A (TrkA), which is known to bind to APP, fails to interact with the fraction of APP molecules phosphorylated at T668  (APP(pT668) ). Accordingly, the amount of TrkA bound to APP is significantly reduced in the hippocampus of ShcC KO mice and of patients with AD in which elevated APP(pT668) levels are detected. NGF promotes TrkA binding to APP and APP trafficking to the Golgi, where APP-BACE interaction is hindered, finally resulting in reduced generation of sAPPß, CTFß and amyloid-beta (1-42).

In this study, we reported that Sp1 mRNA and protein expression were markedly increased in the brain [MASK] APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice, whereas chronic administration [MASK] mithramycin A (MTM), a selective Sp1 inhibitor, potently inhibited Sp1 activation in the APPswe/PS1dE9 mice down to the levels [MASK] wild-type mice.

In addition, MTM treatment was powerfully effective in inhibiting amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing via suppressing APP, beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), and presenilin-1 (PS1)  mRNA and protein expression to preclude Aß production in the APPswe/PS1dE9 mice.  Furthermore, MTM treatment strongly inhibited phosphorylated CDK5 and GSK3ß signal pathways to reduce tau hyperphosphorylation in the APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. Collectively, our findings provide evidence that Sp1 activation may contribute to the AD pathogenesis and may serve as a novel therapeutic target in the treatment  [MASK] AD.

      "[CLS] OBJECTIVE: To investigate the top late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) risk loci detected or confirmed by the International Genomics of Alzheimers Project for association with brain gene expression levels to identify variants that influence Alzheimer disease (AD) risk through gene expression regulation. METHODS: Expression levels from the cerebellum (CER) and temporal cortex (TCX) were obtained using Illumina whole-genome cDNA-mediated annealing, selection, extension, and ligation assay (WG-DASL) for ~400 autopsied patients (~200 with AD and ~200 with non-AD pathologies). We tested 12 significant LOAD genome-wide association study (GWAS) index single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for cis association with levels of 34 genes within ±100 kb. We [MASK] evaluated brain levels of 14 LOAD GWAS candidate genes for association with 1,899 cis-SNPs. Significant associations were validated in a subset of TCX samples using next-generation RNA sequencing (RNAseq). RESULTS: We identified strong associations of brain CR1, HLA-DRB1, and PILRB levels with LOAD GWAS index SNPs. We [MASK] detected other strong cis-SNPs for LOAD candidate genes MEF2C, ZCWPW1, and SLC24A4. MEF2C and SLC24A4, but not ZCWPW1 cis-SNPs, [MASK] associate with LOAD risk, independent of the index SNPs. The TCX expression associations could be validated with RNAseq for CR1, HLA-DRB1, ZCWPW1, and SLC24A4. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that some LOAD GWAS variants mark brain regulatory loci, nominate genes under regulation by LOAD risk variants, and annotate these variants for their brain regulatory effects.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 PUFAs) from fish and plant sources are commonly considered as a promising non-medical alternative to improve brain functions and slow down the progression of [MASK]. This assumption is mostly based on findings of preclinical studies and epidemiological research. Resulting explanatory models aim at the role omega-3 PUFAs play in the  development and integrity of the brains neurons, their protective antioxidative  effect on cell membranes and potential neurochemical mechanisms directly related  to Alzheimer-specific pathology. Epidemiological research also found evidence of  malnutrition in people with [MASK]. Considering this and the fact that omega-3  PUFA cannot be synthesised by humans, omega-3 PUFAs might be a promising treatment option for [MASK]. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation for the treatment of people with [MASK]. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (ALOIS), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) portal/ICTRP on 10 December 2015. We contacted manufacturers of omega-3 supplements and scanned reference lists of landmark papers and included articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which omega-3 PUFA in the form of supplements or enriched diets were administered to people with Alzheimers disease (AD), vascular [MASK] (VaD), [MASK] with Lewy bodies (DLB), Parkinsons disease [MASK] (PDD) or frontotemporal [MASK] (FTD). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The primary outcome measures of interest were changes in global and specific cognitive functions, functional performance, [MASK] severity and adverse effects. Two review authors independently selected  studies, extracted data and assessed the quality of trials according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We rated the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We received unpublished data from the trial authors and collected adverse effects information from the published articles. We conducted meta-analyses for available outcome measures at six months. MAIN RESULTS: We included three comparable randomised, placebo-controlled trials  investigating omega-3 PUFA supplements in 632 participants with mild to moderate  AD over six, 12 and 18 months. We found no studies investigating other types of [MASK]. All trials were of high methodological quality. The overall quality of  evidence for most of the outcomes was high.There was no evidence of a benefit from omega-3 PUFAs on cognitive function when measured at six months with the Alzheimers Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive subscale (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.19 to 0.15; 566 participants; 3 studies; high quality evidence) or Mini-Mental State Examination  (mean difference (MD) 0.18, 95% CI -1.05 to 1.41; 202 participants; 2 studies; high quality evidence) or on activities of daily living (SMD -0.02, 95% CI -0.19  to 0.16; 544 participants; 2 studies; high quality evidence). There was also no effect at six months of treatment on severity of [MASK] measured with the Clinical Dementia Rating - Sum of Boxes (MD -0.00, 95% CI -0.58 to 0.57; 542 participants; 2 studies; high quality evidence) or on quality of life measured with the Quality of Life Alzheimers Disease scale (MD -0.10, 95% CI -1.28 to 1.08; 322 participants; 1 study; high quality evidence). There was no difference  at six months on mental health measured with the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MD -0.10, 95% CI -0.74 to 0.54; 178 participants: 1 study; high quality of evidence) or the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (SMD 0.10, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.27; 543 participants; 2 studies; high quality of evidence). One very small study showed a benefit for omega-3 PUFAs in instrumental activities of daily living after 12 months of treatment (MD -3.50, 95% CI -4.30 to -2.70; 22 participants; moderate quality evidence). The included studies did not measure specific cognitive function. The studies did not report adverse events well. Two  studies stated that all adverse events were mild and that they did not differ in  overall frequency between omega-3 PUFA and placebo groups. Data from one study showed no difference between groups in frequency of any adverse event (risk ratio (RR) 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.10; 402 participants; 1 study; moderate quality evidence) or any serious adverse event (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.41; 402 participants; 1 study; high quality evidence) at 18 months of treatment. AUTHORS CONCLUSIONS: We found no convincing evidence for the efficacy of omega-3 PUFA supplements in the treatment of mild to moderate AD. This result was consistent for all outcomes relevant for people with [MASK]. Adverse effects of omega-3 PUFAs seemed to be low, but based on the evidence synthesised in this review, we cannot make a final statement on tolerability. The effects on other populations remain unclear. [SEP]\t\tdementia\n",

      "[CLS] Recent studies have shown that inoculation of susceptible mice with amyloid-ß (Aß) peptides accelerates Aß deposition in the brain, supporting the idea that Aß may be self-amplifying; however, the exact mechanism is not understood. Here we provide evidence that Aß may self-amplify, in part, by inhibiting a-secretase ADAM10 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) cleavage of full-length Aß precursor protein (FL AßPP) and therefore allow greater ß-secretase processing, and that Aß itself is a substrate for ADAM10. Exposure of primary neuronal cultures from PDAßPP mice to exogenous rat Aß1- 40 resulted in increased de novo human Aß1-42 production and exposure of cells to Aß decreased production of ADAM10 cleavage product soluble AßPPa (sAßPPa). In a cell-free assay, Aß decreased ADAM10 cleavage of the chimeric substrate MBP-AßPPC125 and Aß itself was apparently cleaved by the enzyme. The axonal guidance and trophic factor netrin-1, however,  reduced the Aß1- 40-induced Aß1-42 increase, increased sAßPPa, and reversed the Aß-induced sAßPPa decrease in vitro. In vivo, induction of netrin-1 expression in PDAßPPSwe/Ind transgenic mice resulted in reductions in both Aß1-42 and Aß1- 40,  and ICV delivery of netrin-1 to PDAßPPSwe/Ind mice increased sAßPPa, decreased Aß, and improved working memory.

      "[CLS] Alzheimers disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive deterioration of cognitive function. Pathogenesis of AD is incompletely understood; evidence suggests a role for epigenetic regulation, in particular the cytosine modifications 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). 5hmC is [MASK] in the nervous system and displays neurodevelopment and age-related changes. To determine the role of 5hmC  in AD, we performed genome-wide analyses of 5hmC in DNA from prefrontal cortex of post-mortem AD patients, and RNA-Seq to correlate changes in 5hmC with transcriptional changes. We identified 325 genes containing differentially hydroxymethylated loci (DhMLs) in both discovery and replication datasets. These  are [MASK] for pathways involved in neuron projection development and neurogenesis. Of these, 140 showed changes in gene expression. Proteins encoded by these genes form direct protein-protein interactions with AD-associated genes, expanding the network of genes implicated in AD.

Finally, using an existing AD fly model, we showed some of these genes modulate AD-associated toxicity. Our data implicate neuronal projection development and neurogenesis pathways as potential targets in AD. By incorporating epigenomic and transcriptomic data with genome-wide association studies data, with verification in the Drosophila model, we can expand the known  network of genes involved in disease pathogenesis and identify epigenetic modifiers of Alzheimers disease.

We examined the epigenetic regulatory mechanism of HMOX1 and its application as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for AD. Our results show that HMOX1 mRNA and  protein expression was approximately 12.2-fold and 7.9-fold increased in H4-sw cells, respectively. Increased HMOX1 expression was also detected in the brain, particularly the hippocampus, of AD model transgenic mice. However, the methylation of specific CpG sites within its promoter, particularly at CpG located -374 was significantly decreased in H4-sw cells. Treatment of neuroglioma cells with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine resulted in reduced methylation of HMOX1 promoter accompanied by enhanced HMOX1 expression strongly supporting DNA [MASK] transcriptional regulation of HMOX1. Toxic Aß-induced aberrant hypomethylation of HMOX1 at -374 promoter CpG site was correlated with increased HMOX1 expression.

OBJECTIVE: to review the published evidence to determine the tolerability of ABPM in people with dementia. METHODS: English language search conducted in MEDLINE and EMBASE, using Ambulatory [MASK] pressure AND Dementia (and associated synonyms) from 1996 to March 2015. INCLUSION CRITERIA: people diagnosed with dementia AND in whom [MASK] pressure was measured using ABPM. The initial search was undertaken using title and abstract reviews, with selected papers being agreed for inclusion by two reviewers. Potentially eligible papers were assessed, and high-quality papers were retained. Two reviewers agreed the abstracted data for analysis. Meta-analysis was used to  combine results across studies. RESULTS: of the 221 screened abstracts, 13 studies (6%) met inclusion criteria, 5 had sufficient data and were of sufficient quality, involving 461 participants, most of whom had mild-moderate dementia. 77.7% (95% CI 62.2-93.2%) were able to tolerate ABPM; agreement with office BP was moderate to weak (two studies only-coefficients 0.3-0.38 for systolic [MASK] pressure and 0.11-0.32 for diastolic [MASK] pressure). One study compared home BP monitoring by a relative or ambulatory BP monitoring with office BP measures and found high agreement (? 0.81). The little available evidence suggested increased levels of dementia being associated with reduced tolerability.

We reviewed the different definitions, approaches and measurements used to operationalize dementia in health care studies in German nursing homes with the aim of discussing the implications of different approaches. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of the MEDLINE and CINAHL databases to  identify pre-2016 studies conducted in German nursing homes that focused on residents with dementia or cognitive impairment. In- or exclusion of studies were consented by all authors; data extraction was independently carried out by 2 authors (RP, SJ). The studies sampling methods were compared with respect to their inclusion criteria, assessment tools and methods used to identify the study population. RESULTS: We summarized [MASK] ascertainment methods from 64 studies. Study participants were identified based on a diagnosis that was evaluated during the study, or a recorded medical dementia diagnosis, or a recorded medical diagnosis  either with additional cognitive screenings or using screening tests exclusively. The descriptions of the diagnostics that were applied to assess a diagnosis of dementia were not fully transparent in most of the studies with respect to either a clear reference definition of dementia or applied diagnostic criteria. If reported, various neuropsychological tests were used, mostly without a clear rationale for their selection. CONCLUSION: Pragmatic considerations often determine the sampling strategy; they  also may explain the variances we detected in the different studies. Variations in sampling methods impede the comparability of study results. There is a need to consent [MASK] ascertainment strategies in dementia studies in health service research in nursing homes. These strategies should consider resource constraints  and ethical issues that are related to the vulnerable population of nursing home  residents. Additionally, reporting about dementia studies in nursing homes need to be improved. If a diagnosis cannot be evaluated based on either ICD or DSM criteria, the study population may not be reported as having dementia.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Recent genome-wide association studies revealed TREM2 rs75932628-T variant to be associated with Alzheimers disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases. However, the role that TREM2 plays in sporadic AD is  largely unknown. Our aim was to assess messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels and DNA methylation profiling of TREM2 in human hippocampus in AD brain. We measured  TREM2 mRNA levels in the hippocampus in a cohort of neuropathologically confirmed controls and pure AD cases showing no other protein deposits than ß-amyloid and phosphorylated tau. We also examined DNA methylation levels in the TREM2 transcription start site [MASK] region by bisulfite cloning sequencing  and further extended the study by measuring 5-hydroxymethycytosine (5hmC) enrichment at different regions of TREM2 by 5hmC DNA immunoprecipitation combined with real-time qPCR. RESULTS: A 3.4-fold increase in TREM2 mRNA levels was observed in the hippocampus of AD cases compared to controls (p?=?1.1E-05). Interestingly, TREM2 methylation  was higher in AD cases compared to controls (76.2 %?±?15.5 versus 57.9 %?±?17.1;  p?=?0.0016). Moreover, TREM2 mRNA levels in the AD hippocampus correlated with enrichment in 5hmC at the TREM2 gene body (r?=?0.771; p?=?0.005). CONCLUSIONS: TREM2 mRNA levels are increased in the human hippocampus in AD cases compared to controls. DNA methylation, and particularly 5hmC, may be involved in  regulating TREM2 mRNA expression in the AD brain. Further studies are guaranteed  to investigate in depth the role of 5hmC in AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. [SEP]\t\t(TSS)-associated\n",

The concept of a long, intermediary, prodromal phase between the first appearance of amyloid plaques and tangles and the manifestation of dementia is now well established. The major challenge for the next decade is to chart the many cellular processes that underlie this phase and link the biochemical alterations to the clinical manifestation of Alzheimers disease.

      "[CLS] OBJECTIVE: Identifying mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects who will progress to Alzheimers disease (AD) is not only crucial in clinical practice, but [MASK] has a significant potential to enrich clinical trials. The purpose of this study  is to develop an effective biomarker for an accurate prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion from magnetic resonance images. METHODS: We propose a novel grading biomarker for the prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion. First, we comprehensively study the effects of several important factors on the performance in the prediction task including registration accuracy, age correction, feature selection, and the selection of training data.  Based on the studies of these factors, a grading biomarker is then calculated for each MCI subject using sparse representation techniques. Finally, the grading biomarker is combined with age and cognitive measures to provide a more accurate  prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion. RESULTS: Using the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, the proposed global grading biomarker achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in the range of 79-81% for the prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion within three years in tenfold cross validations. The classification AUC further increases to 84-92% when age and cognitive measures are combined with the proposed grading biomarker. CONCLUSION: The obtained accuracy of the proposed biomarker benefits from the contributions of different factors: a tradeoff registration level to align images to the template space, the removal of the normal aging effect, selection of discriminative voxels, the calculation of the grading biomarker using AD and normal control groups, and the integration of sparse representation technique and the combination of cognitive measures. SIGNIFICANCE: The evaluation on the ADNI dataset shows the efficacy of the proposed biomarker and demonstrates a significant contribution in accurate prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion.

      "[CLS] OBJECTIVE: The diagnostic accuracy of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for Alzheimers disease (AD) must be improved before widespread clinical use. This study aimed to determine whether CSF Aß42/Aß40 and Aß42/Aß38 ratios are better diagnostic biomarkers of AD during both predementia and dementia stages in comparison to CSF Aß42 alone. METHODS: The study comprised three different cohorts (n = 1182) in whom CSF levels of Aß42, Aß40, and Aß38 were assessed. CSF Aßs were quantified using three different immunoassays (Euroimmun, Meso Scale Discovery, Quanterix). As reference [MASK] we used either amyloid ((18)F-flutemetamol) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging (n = 215) or clinical diagnosis (n = 967) of well-characterized patients. RESULTS: When using three different immunoassays in cases with subjective cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment, the CSF Aß42/Aß40 and Aß42/Aß38  ratios were significantly better predictors of abnormal amyloid PET than CSF Aß42. Lower Aß42, Aß42/Aß40, and Aß42/Aß38 ratios, but not Aß40 and Aß38, correlated with smaller hippocampal volumes measured by magnetic resonance imaging. However, lower Aß38, Aß40, and Aß42, but not the ratios, correlated with non-AD-specific subcortical changes, that is, larger lateral ventricles and white matter lesions. Further, the Aß42/Aß40 and Aß42/Aß38 ratios showed increased accuracy compared to Aß42 when distinguishing AD from dementia with Lewy bodies or Parkinsons disease dementia and subcortical vascular dementia, where all Aßs  (including Aß42) were decreased. INTERPRETATION: The CSF Aß42/Aß40 and Aß42/Aß38 ratios are significantly better than CSF Aß42 to detect brain amyloid deposition in prodromal AD and to differentiate AD dementia from non-AD dementias. The ratios reflect AD-type pathology better, whereas decline in CSF Aß42 is also associated with non-AD subcortical pathologies. These findings strongly suggest that the ratios rather than CSF Aß42 should be used in the clinical work-up of AD. [SEP]\t\tstandard,\n",

      "[CLS] The serine hydrolase butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), like the related enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE), co-regulates metabolism of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. In the human brain BChE is mainly expressed in white matter and glia and in distinct populations of neurons in regions that are important in cognition and behavior, functions compromised in Alzheimers disease (AD). AD is  a neurodegenerative disorder causing dementia with no cure [MASK] means for definitive diagnosis during life. In AD, BChE is found in association with pathology, such as ß-amyloid (Aß) plaques, particularly in the cerebral cortex where BChE is not [MASK]mally found in quantity. Up to 30% of cognitively [MASK]mal older adults have abundant Aß deposition in the brain. We have designed an imaging agent that can detect, through autoradiography, BChE-associated Aß plaques in the cerebral cortex of AD brains, but does not visualize Aß plaques in brains of cognitively [MASK]mal individuals. Furthermore, in an AD mouse model with  BChE gene knocked out, there are up to 70% fewer fibrillar Aß brain plaques, suggesting diminished BChE activity could prove beneficial as a curative approach to AD. To that end, we have examined numerous N-10-carbonyl phenothiazines that are specific inhibitors of human BChE, revealing important details of the enzymes active site gorge. These phenothiazines can be designed without potential side effects caused by neurotransmitter receptor interactions. In conclusion, BChE is potentially an important target for diagnosis and treatment of AD. [SEP]\t\tnor\n",

      "[CLS] INTRODUCTION: To assess the reliability of short versions of the Australian National University Alzheimers Disease Risk Index (ANU-ADRI). METHODS: A short form of the ANU-ADRI (ANU-ADRI-SF) was developed by assessing risk and protective factors with single questions where possible and with short forms of sub-questionnaires where available. The tick box form of the ANU-ADRI (ANU-ADRI-TB) was developed with unique questions for each risk and protective factor for Alzheimers disease. The short versions were evaluated in an [MASK] community sample of 504 participants with a mean age of 45.01 (SD = 14.85, range = 18-81). RESULTS: The short versions demonstrated high reliabilities when compared with the ANU-ADRI.

      "[CLS] OBJECTIVE: To examine whether depressive symptoms after a stroke or a transient ischemic attack (TIA) increase the risk of cognitive impairment and functional deterioration at 2-year follow-up. METHODS: Participants were survivors of [MASK] mild-to-moderate ischemic stroke or TIA from the TABASCO prospective cohort study who underwent 3T magnetic resonance imaging and were examined by a multiprofessional team 6, 12, and 24 months after the event using direct interviews, depression scales, and neurologic, neuropsychological, and functional evaluations. The main outcome was  the development of cognitive impairment, either mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia. MCI was diagnosed by a decline on at least 1 cognitive domain (= 1.5 SD) of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment score and/or on the computerized neuropsychological battery, as compared with age- and education-matched published norms. Dementia was diagnosed by a consensus forum that included senior neurologists specializing in memory disorders and a neuropsychologist. RESULTS: Data were obtained from 306 consecutive eligible patients (mean age: 67.1 ± 10.0 years) who were admitted to the department of emergency medicine at the Tel Aviv Medical Center from April 1, 2008, to December 1, 2011, within 72 hours from onset of symptoms of TIA or stroke. Of these patients, 51 (16.7%) developed cognitive impairment during a 2-year follow-up. Multivariate regression analysis showed that a Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) score = 6 at admission and at 6 months after the event was a significant independent marker of cognitive impairment 2 years after the stroke/TIA (OR = 3.62, 95% CI, 1.01-13.00; OR = 3.68, 95% CI, 1.03-13.21, respectively). A higher GDS score at 6 months was also  related to a worse functional outcome (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Our results support depression screening among stroke and TIA survivors as a tool to identify patients who are prone to have a worse cognitive  and functional outcome. These patients may benefit from closer medical surveillance and a more intensive treatment approach. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01926691. [SEP]\t\tfirst-ever,\n",

The effect of repeatedly scanning was evaluated by scanning Tg and WT mice at days 1, 4, and 7. Brain (18)F-FDG uptake was evaluated in the thalamus being the [MASK] indicative region. Finally, the cerebellum was tested as a reference region for the relative standard uptake value (rSUV).

In addition, the relationship between miRNAs and mini mental state examination (MMSE) scores in AD patients was also assessed. Serum miR-29, [MASK] and miR-223 were significantly decreased, but serum miR-519 was significantly increased in AD patients compared with healthy blood donors. In addition, serum miR-223 was strongly positively correlated with MMSE score in AD  patients but serum miR-519 was not. Importantly, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) result of serum miR-223 for prediction of AD was 0.786, higher than those of serum miR-29 (0.734) or [MASK] (0.726). The combination of serum miR-223 and [MASK] gave improved sensitivity/specificity for AD prediction (area under the ROC curve, 0.879) than either miRNA alone.

Confirmation that presenilin is the catalytic site of ?-secretase has provided a  linchpin: all dominant mutations causing early-onset AD occur either in the substrate (amyloid precursor protein, APP) or the protease (presenilin) of the reaction that generates Aß. Duplication of the wild-type APP gene in Downs syndrome leads to Aß deposits in the teens, followed by microgliosis, astrocytosis, and neurofibrillary tangles typical of AD Apolipoprotein E4, which  predisposes to AD in > 40% of cases, has been found to impair Aß clearance from the brain. Soluble oligomers of Aß42 isolated from AD patients brains can decrease [MASK] number, inhibit long-term potentiation, and enhance long-term synaptic depression in rodent hippocampus, and injecting them into healthy rats impairs memory. The human oligomers also induce hyperphosphorylation of tau at AD-relevant epitopes and cause neuritic dystrophy in cultured neurons. Crossing human APP with human tau transgenic mice enhances tau-positive neurotoxicity. In  humans, new studies show that low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aß42 and amyloid-PET  positivity precede other AD manifestations by many years. Most importantly, recent trials of three different Aß antibodies (solanezumab, crenezumab, and aducanumab) have suggested a slowing of cognitive decline in post hoc analyses of mild AD subjects. Although many factors contribute to AD pathogenesis, Aß dyshomeostasis has emerged as the most extensively validated and compelling therapeutic target. [SEP]\t\tsynapse\n",

      "[CLS] Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is a multisystemic disease caused by mutations in the ATM (A-T mutated) gene. It strikes before 5 years of age and leads to dysfunctions in many tissues, [MASK] the CNS, where it leads to neurodegeneration, primarily in cerebellum. Alzheimers disease (AD), by contrast, is a largely sporadic neurodegenerative disorder that rarely strikes before the 7th decade of life with primary neuronal losses in hippocampus, frontal cortex, and certain subcortical nuclei. Despite these differences, we present data supporting the hypothesis that a failure of ATM signaling is involved in the neuronal death in individuals with AD. In both, partially ATM-deficient mice and AD mouse models, neurons show evidence for a loss of ATM.  In human AD, three independent indices of reduced ATM function-nuclear translocation of histone deacetylase 4, trimethylation of histone H3, and the presence of cell cycle activity-appear coordinately in neurons in regions where degeneration is prevalent. These same neurons also show reduced ATM protein levels. And though they represent only a fraction of the total neurons in each affected region, their numbers significantly correlate with disease stage. This previously unknown role for the ATM kinase in AD pathogenesis suggests that the failure of ATM function may be an important contributor to the death of neurons in AD individuals.

RESULTS: We demonstrate that the lack of SORLA results in accumulation of phosphorylated synapsins in cortex and hippocampus. We propose an underlying molecular mechanism by demonstrating that SORLA interacts with phosphorylated synapsins through 14-3-3 adaptor proteins to deliver synapsins to calpain-mediated proteolytic degradation.

      "[CLS] Amyloid-ß, [MASK], and a-synuclein, or more specifically their soluble oligomers, are the aetiologic molecules in Alzheimers disease, [MASK]opathies, and a-synucleinopathies, respectively. These proteins have been shown to interact to  accelerate each others pathology. Clinical studies of amyloid-ß-targeting therapies in Alzheimers disease have revealed that the treatments after disease  onset have little benefit on patient cognition. These findings prompted us to explore a preventive medicine which is orally available, has few adverse effects, and is effective at reducing neurotoxic oligomers with a broad spectrum. We initially tested five candidate compounds: rifampicin, curcumin, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, myricetin, and scyllo-inositol, in cells expressing amyloid precursor protein (APP) with the Osaka (E693?) mutation, which promotes amyloid-ß oligomerization. Among these compounds, rifampicin, a well-known antibiotic, showed the strongest activities against the accumulation and toxicity (i.e. cytochrome c release from mitochondria) of intracellular amyloid-ß oligomers. Under cell-free conditions, rifampicin inhibited oligomer formation of amyloid-ß, [MASK], and a-synuclein, indicating its broad spectrum. The inhibitory effects of rifampicin against amyloid-ß and [MASK] oligomers were evaluated in APPOSK mice (amyloid-ß oligomer model), Tg2576 mice (Alzheimers disease model),  and [MASK]609 mice ([MASK]opathy model). When orally administered to 17-month-old APPOSK mice at 0.5 and 1 mg/day for 1 month, rifampicin reduced the accumulation  of amyloid-ß oligomers as well as [MASK] hyperphosphorylation, synapse loss, and microglial activation in a dose-dependent manner. In the Morris water maze, rifampicin at 1 mg/day improved memory of the mice to a level similar to that in  non-transgenic littermates. Rifampicin also inhibited cytochrome c release from the mitochondria and caspase 3 activation in the hippocampus. In 13-month-old Tg2576 mice, oral rifampicin at 0.5 mg/day for 1 month decreased amyloid-ß oligomer accumulation, [MASK] hyperphosphorylation, synapse loss, and microglial activation, but not amyloid deposition. Rifampicin treatment to 14-15-month-old [MASK]609 mice at 0.5 and 1 mg/day for 1 month also reduced [MASK] oligomer accumulation, [MASK] hyperphosphorylation, synapse loss, and microglial activation in a dose-dependent fashion, and improved the memory almost completely at 1 mg/day. In addition, rifampicin decreased the level of p62/sequestosome-1 in the  brain without affecting the increased levels of LC3 (microtubule-associated protein light chain 3) conversion, suggesting the restoration of autophagy-lysosomal function. Considering its prescribed dose and safety in humans, these results indicate that rifampicin could be a promising, ready-to-use medicine for the prevention of Alzheimers disease and other neurodegenerative diseases.

      "[CLS] Alzheimers disease (AD) is an irreversible brain disorder characterized by progressive cognitive decline and neurodegeneration of brain regions that are crucial for learning and memory. Although intracellular neurofibrillary tangles and extracellular senile plaques, composed of insoluble amyloid-ß (Aß) peptides,  have been the hallmarks of [MASK] AD brains, memory impairment in early AD correlates better with pathological accumulation of soluble Aß oligomers and persistent weakening of excitatory synaptic strength, which is demonstrated by inhibition of long-term potentiation, enhancement of long-term depression, and loss of synapses. However, current, approved interventions aiming to reduce Aß levels have failed to retard disease progression; this has led to a pressing need to identify and target alternative pathogenic mechanisms of AD. Recently, it has  been suggested that the disruption of Hebbian synaptic plasticity in AD is due to aberrant metaplasticity, which is a form of homeostatic plasticity that tunes the magnitude and direction of future synaptic plasticity based on previous neuronal  or synaptic activity. This review examines emerging evidence for aberrant metaplasticity in AD. Putative mechanisms underlying aberrant metaplasticity in AD will also be discussed.

Increased WMH volume is associated [MASK] risk and progression of Alzheimers disease (AD). These observations are typically interpreted as evidence that vascular abnormalities play an additive, independent role contributing to symptom presentation, but not core features of AD. We examined the severity and distribution of WMH in presymptomatic PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP mutation carriers to determine the extent to which WMH manifest in individuals genetically determined to develop AD.

      "[CLS] Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by progressive memory loss, reduction in  [MASK] functions, and damage to the brain.

PS1 mutations can alter the activity of ?-secretase on the cleavage of the ß-amyloid precursor protein, causing increased Aß production. Previous studies show that the ßAPP-C-terminal fragment is first cleaved by ß-scretase, primarily  generating long fragments of Aß48 and Aß49, followed by the stepwise cleavage of  every three amino acid residues at the C terminus, resulting in Aß48-, 45-, 42 line and Aß49-, 46-, 43-, 40 line.

The results show that most FAD mutant PS1 can alter the level of Aß42 and Aß40 monitored by the Aß42/Aß40 ratio. Among them, six mutants (I143T, H163P, S170F, Q223R, M233V, and  G384A) affect the Aß42/40 ratio through both Aß49-40 and Aß48-38 lines; L166P through decreasing the Aß49-40 line, six mutants (I143V, M146V, G217A, E280A, L381V, and L392V) through increasing the Aß48-42 line.

METHODS: Two men with AD and one man with progressive nonfluent aphasia received  10 treatment sessions focused on relearning the names of 20 animals and 20 fruits. Within each category, half of the items were of high and half were of low typicality. We individualized treatment items to each participant, using items that each had not named correctly at baseline. Treatment sessions consisted of naming, category sorting, and semantic feature verification tasks. RESULTS: Both participants with AD showed post-treatment improvements in naming,  and one maintained the treatment effects at 6-week follow-up. The semantic category of the treatment items influenced post-treatment outcomes, but typicality did not. In contrast to the participants with AD, the man with progressive nonfluent aphasia had no improvement in naming ability. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest the potential viability of semantic feature training to treat anomia in AD and, therefore, the need for further research. [SEP]\t\tAnomia\n",

      "[CLS] [MASK] gene has been identified as a strong genetic locus for Alzheimers disease  (AD) susceptibility in genome wide association studies (GWAS). However, the possible roles of [MASK] variants in AD pathology were not specifically assessed.  Using tagger methods, we extracted 15 targeted [MASK] loci to investigate their associations with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and neuroimaging markers in Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Finally, although we  did not detect any significant associations of previously published GWAS SNPs (rs3764650 and rs78117248) with all the CSF (Aß1 - 42, T-tau, and P-tau) and neuroimaging markers, three other variants (rs3752242, rs3752240, and rs4147912)  at [MASK] loci were detected to show significant associations with amyloid deposition on AV-45 PET in brain. Moreover, haplotype and subgroup analysis confirmed these significant findings. Furthermore, there were no remarkable correlations between [MASK] variants and neuronal degeneration biomarkers (elevated CSF tau, brain structure atrophy, and hypometabolism on imaging) in this study. Thus, our study suggested that [MASK] genotypes contribute to the AD risk through involvement in amyloid-ß deposition on in vivo imaging, but not in tau pathology, brain atrophy, or decreased glucose metabolism.

      "[CLS] BACKGROUND: Over the past 20 years, many researchers have worked in developing various methods for measuring quality of life (QoL) of people with dementia. The  aim of this review is to develop the conceptual frameworks of the dementia-specific QoL instruments, to [MASK] their evolution over time and to provide elements of reflection on the QoL concept in dementia and its evaluation. METHODS: An electronic search was conducted on PsycINFO and MEDLINE databases, from January 1985 to June 2015 using a combination of key words that include QoL, dementia, and review. RESULTS: The analysis of the conceptual frameworks of the 18 selected dementia-specific QoL tools shows a great diversity in: (1) the QoL definitions (e.g. health-related QoL definitions, QoL definitions based on Lawtons work, or  similar to this latter); (2) the theoretical QoL models (e.g. Lawton work and modified Lawton, adaptation, personhood); (3) the domains and dimensions; (4) the way to construct the instrument (e.g. development based on literature, opinion of the experts), and (5) the items formulation (e.g. use of criterion of intensity  or frequency). CONCLUSIONS: There are different conceptual frameworks in the dementia-specific QoL measures with improvements over time (e.g. inclusion of interesting concepts  such as adaptation, taking into account the views of patients themselves). Each of the conceptual parameters (definitions, models, domains, and dimensions) is discussed to [MASK] the scales that are conceptually the strongest. Through their review, recommendations for future instrument refinement and development are discussed and a new QoL definition is proposed. [SEP]\t\tidentify\n",

      "[CLS] More than 46 million people worldwide suffer from Alzheimers disease. A [MASK] number of potential treatments have been proposed; among these, the inhibition of the aggregation of amyloid ß-peptide (Aß), considered one of the main culprits in Alzheimers disease. Limitations in monitoring the aggregation of Aß in cells and tissues restrict the screening of anti-amyloid drugs to in vitro studies in most  cases. We have developed a simple but powerful method to track Aß aggregation in  vivo in real-time, using bacteria as in vivo amyloid reservoir. We use the specific amyloid dye Thioflavin-S (Th-S) to stain bacterial inclusion bodies (IBs), in this case mainly formed of Aß in amyloid conformation. Th-S binding to  amyloids leads to an increment of fluorescence that can be monitored. The quantification of the Th-S fluorescence along the time allows tracking Aß aggregation and the effect of potential anti-aggregating agents. [SEP]\t\tlarge\n",

      "[CLS] The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between brain regional gray [MASK] volume and two subtypes of psychotic symptoms, namely paranoid and misidentification subtypes, in antipsychotic-naïve mild or moderate  Alzheimers disease (AD) patients. Forty AD patients with psychotic symptoms and  25 AD patients without psychotic symptoms were assessed for cognitive and functional impairment. Presence and subtype of psychotic symptoms were assessed by using the delusion and hallucination subscale of the Korean Neuropsychiatric Inventory (K-NPI). Structural MRI images were acquired on a 3 T scanner, and were analyzed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) for automated analysis. The misidentification subtype is associated with more severe gray [MASK] atrophy, and paranoid subtype is associated with less severe gray [MASK] atrophy compared to non-psychosis group. These results suggest that the misidentification, the paranoid subtype and the non-psychosis group have a distinct neural correlation. [SEP]\t\tmatter\n",

      "[CLS] In [MASK] paper, based on [MASK] electrophysiological experimental data, [MASK] Hippocampal neuron reduced model under [MASK] pathology condition of Alzheimers disease (AD) has been built by modifying parameters values. The reduced neuron models dynamic characteristics under effect of AD are comparatively studied. Under direct current stimulation, compared with [MASK] normal neuron model, [MASK] AD neuron models dynamic characteristics have obviously been changed. The neuron model under [MASK] AD condition undergoes supercritical Andronov-Hopf bifurcation from [MASK] rest state to [MASK] continuous discharge state. It is different from [MASK] neuron model under [MASK] normal condition, which undergoes saddle-node bifurcation. So, [MASK] neuron model changes into a resonator with monostable state from an integrator with bistable state under ADs action. The research reveals [MASK] neuron models dynamic characteristics changing under effect of AD, and provides some [MASK]oretic basis for AD research by neurodynamics [MASK]ory. [SEP]\t\tthe\n",

      "[CLS] PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to explore the cerebral distribution of the tau-specific PET tracer [(18)F]THK5317 (also known as (S)-[(18)F]THK5117) retention in different stages of Alzheimers disease; and study any associations  with markers of hypometabolism and amyloid-beta deposition. METHODS: Thirty-three individuals were enrolled, including nine patients with Alzheimers disease dementia, thirteen with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), two  with non-Alzheimers disease dementia, and nine healthy controls (five young and  four elderly). In a multi-tracer PET design [(18)F]THK5317, [(11)C] Pittsburgh compound B ([(11)C]PIB), and [(18)F]FDG were used to assess tau pathology, amyloid-beta deposition and cerebral glucose metabolism, respectively. The MCI patients were further divided into MCI [(11)C]PIB-positive (n?=?11) and MCI [(11)C]PIB-negative (n?=?2) groups. [MASK] Test-retest variability for [(18)F]THK5317-PET was very low (1.17-3.81 %), as shown by retesting five patients. The patients with prodromal (MCI [(11)C]PIB-positive) and dementia-stage Alzheimers disease had significantly higher [(18)F]THK5317 retention than healthy controls (p?=?0.002 and p?=?0.001, respectively) in areas exceeding limbic regions, and their discrimination from this control group (using the area under the curve) was >98 %. Focal negative correlations between [(18)F]THK5317 retention and [(18)F]FDG uptake were observed mainly in the frontal cortex, and focal positive  correlations were found between [(18)F]THK5317 and [(11)C]PIB retentions isocortically. One patient with corticobasal degeneration syndrome and one with progressive supranuclear palsy showed no [(11)C]PIB but high [(18)F]THK5317 retentions with a different regional distribution from that in Alzheimers disease patients. CONCLUSIONS: The tau-specific PET tracer [(18)F]THK5317 images in vivo the expected regional distribution of tau pathology. This distribution contrasts with the different patterns of hypometabolism and amyloid-beta deposition. [SEP]\t\tRESULTS:\n",

      "[CLS] During wakefulness, extracellular levels of metabolites in the brain increase. These include amyloid beta (Aß), [MASK] contributes to the pathogenesis of Alzheimers disease (AD). Counterbalancing their accumulation in the brain, sleep facilitates the removal of these metabolites from the extracellular space by convective flow of the interstitial fluid from the para-arterial to the para-venous space. However, when the sleep-wake cycle is disrupted (characterized by increased brain levels of the wake-promoting neuropeptide orexin and increased neural activity), the central nervous system (CNS) clearance of extracellular metabolites is diminished. Disruptions to the sleep-wake cycle have furthermore been linked to increased neuronal oxidative stress and impaired blood-brain barrier function - conditions that have also been proposed to play a role in the  development and progression of AD. Notably, recent human and transgenic animal studies have demonstrated that AD-related pathophysiological processes that occur long before the clinical onset of AD, such as Aß deposition in the brain, disrupt sleep and circadian rhythms. Collectively, as proposed in this review, these findings suggest the existence of a mechanistic interplay between AD pathogenesis and disrupted sleep-wake cycles, [MASK] is able to accelerate the development and  progression of this disease.

      "[CLS] Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and Alzheimers disease (AD) are neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders respectively, with devastating effects not only on the individual but also the society. Collectively, a number of factors contribute to the [MASK] of ASD and AD. It is of utmost curiosity  that these disorders express at different stages of life and there is an involvement of certain susceptible genes. This genetic basis makes the background of common associations like memory deficits, cognition changes, demyelination, oxidative stress and inflammation, an integral part of both disorders. Modern technology resulting in genetically modified crops and increase in gadgets emitting electromagnetic frequencies have resulted in enhanced risks for neurological dysfunctions and disorders like ASD and AD. Subsequent advances in the psychological, pharmacological, biochemical and nutritional aspects of the disorders have resulted in the development of newer therapeutic approaches. The common clinical features like language impairment, executive functions, and motor problems have been discussed along with the patho-physiological changes, role of  DNA methylation, myelin development, and heavy metals in the [MASK] of these  disorders. Psychopharmacological and nutritional approaches towards the reduction and management of risk factors have gained attention from the researchers in recent years. Current major therapies either target the inflammatory pathways or  reduce cellular oxidative stress. This contribution focuses on the commonalities  of the two disorders. [SEP]\t\texpression\n",

      "[CLS] ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Recently, the focus on neuroinflammation is intensified as its complex pathophysiological role has emerged in multiple central nervous system(CNS) disorders. Chotosan (CTS), known as a traditional herbal formula, is often utilized to treat relevant nervous system diseases in China. It was demonstrated effectively to alleviate cognitive deficit associated  with aging, diabetes, hypoperfusion and cerebral ischemia. However, the effects of CTS on Aß1-42-induced cognitive dysfunction remain unclear. Here, we further investigated the effects of chotosan on memory performance, neuroinflammation and apoptotic responses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: [MASK] learning and memory ability is evaluated by Morris water maze (MWM) task and Y-maze test following intrahippocampal infusion of aggregated Aß1-42. [MASK] expression level of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4), NF-?B p65, Bcl-2 and Bax was examined by Western blot. TLR-4 level is also assessed by  immunohistochemistry (IHC). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was conducted to determine the generation of inflammatory mediators. [MASK] caspase-3 activity is analyzed by commercial kits. RESULTS: [MASK] repeated treatment with CTS (750mg/kg or 375mg/kg per day) for 3 weeks significantly restored Aß1-42-induced memory impairment in mice. Meanwhile, this treatment also remarkably reduced TLR-4 and NF-?B p65 expression accompanying with the diminished release of proinflammatory cytokines including TNF-a and IL-1ß in hippocampus. [MASK] neuronal apoptosis is also inhibited as evidenced by increase in Bcl-2/Bax ratio and decrease in pro-apoptotic protein caspase-3 activity compared to that of the model mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show for the first time that chotosan can ameliorate Aß1-2-induced memory dysfunction via inhibiting neuroinflammation and apoptosis at least partially mediated by TLR-4/NF-?B signaling pathway.

      "[CLS] Alzheimers disease (AD), as the most common progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is pathologically characterized by deposition of extracellular plaque composed of amyloid-ß peptide (Aß). Different assembled states of Aß have been considered as both important biomarkers and drug targets for the diagnosis and therapy of AD. Recent studies demonstrate that small, diffusible Aß oligomers formed by aggregation of Aß monomers are the major toxic [MASK] in AD. Therefore, the development of reliable assays for Aß (both monomers and oligomers) will be important for the early differential diagnosis of dementia, predicting the progression of AD, as well as monitoring the effectiveness of novel anti-Aß drugs for AD. In this review, we summarize the recent progress made in the development  of techniques for detection of Aß monomers and oligomers. In particular, the principles governing the design of these sensors are classified and summarized. Moreover, the advantages and disadvantages of the assays are evaluated. This review also discusses the improvements and challenges for application of these assays in the early diagnosis of AD. [SEP]\t\tagents\n",

    "['[CLS] Alzheimers disease, and dementia, represent a common cause of disability and one of the most relevant challenges in the health world. In addition, these conditions do not have, at moment, a pharmacological treatment that can stop the  pathological progress. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), defined as the borderline between normal aging and early dementia, represents a meaningful field of study because, in the transition to dementia, clinicians have defined a useful therapeutic window. Additionally, due to the lack of effective pharmacological interventions, recent years have seen an increase in research into new technological solutions to assess, stimulate, and assist patients afflicted with  Alzheimers disease. This review aims to outline the use of information and communication technologies in the field studying MCI. Particularly, the goal is to depict the framework and describe the most worthwhile research efforts, in order to display the current technologies available, describe the research objectives, and delineate prospective future researches. Regarding data sources,  the research was conducted within three databases, PubMed [MASK] Web of Science, and Scopus, between January 2009 and December 2017. A total of 646 articles were found in the initial search. Accurate definition of the exclusion criteria and selection strategy allowed identification of the most relevant papers to use for the study. Finally, 56 papers were fully evaluated and included in this review. Three major clinical application areas have been portrayed, namely \"Cognitive Assessment,\" \"Treatment,\" and \"Assistance.\" These have been combined with three main technological solutions, specifically \"Sensors,\" \"Personal Devices,\" and \"Robots.\" Furthermore, the study of the publications time series illustrates a steadily increasing trend, characterized by the enrollment of small groups of subjects, and particularly oriented to the subjects assistance using robots companion. In conclusion, despite the new technological solutions for people with MCI have received much interest, particularly regarding robots for assistance, nowadays it still owns vast room for improvement.
